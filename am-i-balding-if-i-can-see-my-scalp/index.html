<p>It is certainly possible but do keep in mind that one can never really confidently diagnosis hair loss with just a picture. I also got a slight headache. It is very normal to see the scalp when your hair is as short as you describe. Balding may not start at the hairline or crown but rather grows and progresses throughout a broader area of your head.</p>
<h3 id="im-actually-visiting-a-dermatologist-soon-to-make-sure-im-not-balding">I’m actually visiting a dermatologist soon to make sure i’m not balding.</h3><p>If you can see your scalp, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going bald. The only family history i have of hair loss is my grandfather from my father’s side. To tell if you�re going bald, examine your hair in a mirror to see if you have a receding hairline, which could be a sign that you�re going bald. Lifting at the root, combing forward or to the side, or wearing your hair in a ponytail or adding waves and curls can all help. I squeezed &amp; kneaded about an hour until my scalp felt a bit tender. Balding happens when the normal hair growth cycle is disrupted.</p>
