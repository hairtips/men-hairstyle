With blondes having a low count of melanin, the pigment that gives human skin, eyes and hair their eventual color, more hair is needed to help get it on its way. Being blonde gives one keen insight into the human condition, a more compassionate nature, and the ability to learn and retain vast amounts of information. Everyone knows that blondes have more fun than brunettes!</p>
