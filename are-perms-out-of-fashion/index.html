The conditioner will protect.</p>

<p>This kind of perm will look more relaxed when the hair is wet but can create nice prominent waves when it dries. Highlights also gives my hair some body but as highlights only affect a tiny part of my hair, a perm gives better results (and needs to do only every 6 or 9 months). Perm is a chemical solution.</p>
