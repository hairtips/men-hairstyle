Let a few extra tendrils fall over the eyes to caress the cheekbones, and tousle the top for some additional lift. These treatments, while repairing damage, also coat the hair and make your styling routine more manageable. For a shorter style that will work well with thick hair, try a bob that�s longer in the front.</p>
<h3 id="in-other-words-when-the-chemical-bonds-in-your-hair">In other words, when the chemical bonds in your hair.</h3><p>Below you can see some very nice examples with wavy and curly bobs. Long hair is not recommended because it can pull out the curls and make the hair look even finer. Similar to skincare, haircare never is. A detangler would help calm the thickness and i�m assuming curliness while you style it. A root fade can help thinning hair look fuller and more voluminous, especially when you have lots of curly ringlets contributing to the goal. The key to properly caring for thin, curly hair is choosing products that nourishe, protect, and define your curls without weighing down thin strands.</p>
