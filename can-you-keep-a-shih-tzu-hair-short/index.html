<p>Dogs with short coats are easier to brush, but if you decide to keep the shih tzu’s fur at its natural length, it is best to clip them. Trim the face as much as you can, and as for the body, you can keep it long or short. You will have to take your pup to the groomers and have him shaved. Maltese shih tzus have short hair that can be any color, but they are most commonly seen in black, white, or brown.</p>
<h3 id="shih-tzu-pros-and-cons-shih-tzu-behavior-problems">Shih tzu pros and cons shih tzu behavior problems</h3><p>If you wish to keep your shih tzu’s coat clipped short it is still important that your puppy becomes used to being groomed as early as possible. Can you keep a shih tzu hair short? A shih tzu communicates just as any dog would communicate (barking, whining, whimpers, mannerisms, eye contact, etc.), though every shih tzu has. Your shih tzus body can be shaved short, left at an inch long, or trimmed any other way. The rest of their hair can be trimmed as short as you’d like (though 1 inch is probably the minimum), and make sure they don’t have hair hanging into their mouths or eyes—that’s just uncomfortable. It doesn’t matter if you have a dog that has long hair or short hair, there will be a haircut that will fit your dog just nicely.</p>
