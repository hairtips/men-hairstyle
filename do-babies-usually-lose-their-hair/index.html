Baby sometimes eat their.</p>

<p>Infants often lose their hair in first year after birth. For a little while, at least, your baby’s thick head of hair may very well go bald. Baby sometimes eat their hair during pregnancy. If baby has a bald patch, maybe she’s resting her head in the same spot day after. Frankly, it’s a little like going out in public.</p>

<p>Lanugo begins to fall out between 32 to 36 weeks of gestation, but it can sometimes remain intact and fall later, after the baby is born, usually around 4 to 6 months. Many babies lose their lanugo in utero (around 32 to 36 weeks), where it’s shed into the amniotic fluid. Some premature babies will still be covered in these.</p>
