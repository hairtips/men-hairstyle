<p>It�s a myth and most likely stems from the idea of men usually increase shaving frequency in adolescence, a period in which the thickness of their beard (supposedly, still waiting for mine to kick in) increases. That�s because a person�s hair naturally tapers at the end. That�s a very common misconception. Shaving facial or body hair gives the hair a blunt tip.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-shave-your-neckline-and-cheekline-your-beard-will-instantly-look-denser">If you shave your neckline and cheekline, your beard will instantly look denser.</h3><p>Shaving cream is, of course, a must… if you’re not shaving under the shower. When shaving, you’re cutting your hair at its thickest point, therefore when it grows back, it seems thicker. When you shave, all you�re doing is mowing down the thin shaft and exposing the thicker part of the hair near the skin. Another study done on hair waxing had similar results. There is nothing scientific to prove that facial hair grows thicker after shaving. The hair that was waxed away did not come back fuller, even after being pulled completely out, not just shaved.</p>

<p>Because as hair is exposed to the sun, it tends to get lighter in color. All shaving does is remove the hair. During my research, i concluded that shaving of beard, will effectively normalize all the hair follicles to just one length and when looking at your beard that is only a couple of days old it may appear thicker.</p>

<p>No — shaving hair doesn�t change its thickness, color or rate of growth. Castor oil is so thick in consistency that it can make your beard look fuller. A beard isn�t the hydra, nor does it work the same way. Shaving your beard makes it seem like it grows back fuller, but that’s an illusion. During my research, i concluded.</p>

<p>Since you cut the old and unhealthy growth, your beard got the chance to grow healthier. Maybe the men with beastly beards pass down wisdom that shaving every day will grow a thicker beard because they tried this advice themselves. Those hormones rise in levels during adolescence. That�s because a person�s hair naturally tapers at the end. When you shave.</p>

<p>However, the misconception is an understandable one. No, shaving your hair has no influence on its thickness, growth rate, or color. Maybe the men with beastly beards pass down wisdom that shaving every day will grow a thicker beard because they tried this advice themselves. The truth is, if shaving every day grew a thicker beard, then more people would.</p>

<p>First of all, if you�re talking about hair that�s exposed to light (such as your beard), shaving may make it look like your hair is growing in thicker. When shaving, you’re cutting your hair at its thickest point, therefore when it grows back, it seems thicker. Does shaving increase beard growth? Heavy beard balms and beard oils can add volume.</p>
