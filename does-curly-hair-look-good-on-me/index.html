<p>The only other times you can comb your curls is after applying a leave in conditioner (explained later in this post) outside the shower and sometimes with oil applied to your hair before you shower. In wavy and curly hair, they are closer and can easily bond among themselves, creating more tension in the hair fiber and contributing to curling..</p>

<p>I do think i look good with both curly hair and straight hair though. What cuts look âgoodâ on curly hair is also a matter of preference; Fine, thick, wavy, kinky â there are a ton of factors to consider when choosing the best hair products for your locks. This distributes the conditioner properly throughout your hair, keeps the curl.</p>

<p>My hair looked curly after applying hair mask on damp hair and leaving it in for hours but looks like mostly straight, slightly frizzy and huge after wash. This distributes the conditioner properly throughout your hair, keeps the curl clumps together and reduces frizz. This curly hair style flatters triangular faces because the layered back and sides allow the curls.</p>

<p>If you want healthy curls that look bouncy and fresh, head to the hairstylist every six to eight weeks for. In wavy and curly hair, they are closer and can easily bond among themselves, creating more tension in the hair fiber and contributing to curling. The straight is more of a novelty for me since i only do it that.</p>

<p>Yes, she looks good with straight hair but thereâs a level of superficiality to that style that doesnât exist in the photo of her with curly hair.

<p>Air dry, diffuse, or use a combination of both. This ensures that your curls will be defined to the root, but wonï¿½t fall flat. It tends to straighten down further as days progress after wash.
