<p>The sharp increase in testosterone levels in the body positively affects hair loss. Fortunately though, it’s as dire as you think it might be. While bleaching and dyeing hair may cause your hair to break off at the root and fall out, this happens only in some cases. The chemicals in hair dye can cause some of the damage.</p>
<h3 id="to-sum-it-all-up-the-hair-loss-that-comes-along-with-permanently-dying-your-hair-is-not-always-hair-loss-because-you-are-beginning-to-go-bald">To sum it all up, the hair loss that comes along with permanently dying your hair is not always hair loss because you are beginning to go bald.</h3><p>One example is chemical straightening. In time, the continuous pulling can damage your hair follicles. To sum it all up, the hair loss that comes along with permanently dying your hair is not always hair loss because you are beginning to go bald. Especially when using hair dyes that are more than three shades away from your natural hair color, dyes can significantly harm the health of your hair. The most damaging side effect is itching. Keratinopathy is a condition that can happen in the hair.</p>
