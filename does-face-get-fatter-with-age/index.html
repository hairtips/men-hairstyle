<p>When you eat a lot of processed food, it may make your face appear tired because your face just like your body is not receiving enough nutrition. With age, your skin thins and grows less elastic. This is the reason the skin sags. There are some effective natural ways to increase fat on the face so that your face looks toned and healthy.</p>
<h3 id="estrogen-always-keeps-melanin-production-at-a-level-where-our-bodies-need-it-to-be">Estrogen always keeps melanin production at a level where our bodies need it to be.</h3><p>Age is characterized by a loss of tissue whether we�re talking about bone or muscle/ fat. As we age, our skin loses collagen and the fatty layer loses its volume. As years pass, facial bones lose volume, contributing to the appearance of aging. For instance, if you were ever a tanner back in the day, or currently are one, menopause has the potential to change the effects on your face with an increase in melanin production. To make your facial features look prominent and good your face must look quite plump. People assume that it will speed up the aging process.</p>
