<h3 id="with-aging-the-outer-skin-layer-epidermis-thins-even-though-the-number-of-cell-layers-remains-unchanged">With aging, the outer skin layer (epidermis) thins, even though the number of cell layers remains unchanged.</h3><p>When we are born, we have round, chubby faces. Round, full faces tend to look younger. With the help of modern technologies, researchers have had a chance to better understand how the facial skeleton changes and which areas are prone to resorption.
