<p>I�ve always had fairly thick chest/stomach hair but little back hair. Finasteride is a prescription hair loss medication used by million of men worldwide.

I will say that if you are considering starting to take finasteride, don’t. Tressless is reddit�s most popular community for males and females coping with hair loss and balding. In the original trials for propecia, the 1mg dosage was found to result in a “significant net increase in hair count” after 12 months. Taking the medicine in hopes of it working for your hair but taking away essentially what. But i�m seriously thinking to stop finasteride and going for a buzzcut.</p>

<p>When someone is going bald certain follicles stop regrowing hair (it actually doesn�t entirely stop but that�s besides the point).

<p>Dht is believed to act on scalp hair follicles to suppress them and gradually create weaker and smaller hair follicles. The following is informational only and does not constitute medical advice. It reduces dht levels in the body by about 70% and can dramatically slow, stop, and even partially reverse hair loss in some men. If anything it’s been worse.</p>

<p>However, my hair loss has still not slowed down at all after nearly 6 months on finasteride. So i could�ve had telogen effluvium which induced my male pattern baldness.

Dht is essential to male development during puberty, but it’s generally thought not to yield many tangible benefits after puberty. You don’t know what kind of side effects.</p>

<p>This reduction in dht is enough to stop hair loss completely in over 80% of the males who take this medicine. By month 3 most men who respond to finasteride notice that they have less daily shedding. So i could�ve had telogen effluvium which induced my male pattern baldness. I started fin with mild hairline recession (nw2.5 maybe). This reduction.</p>

<p>Specifically, after five years, 48% of men demonstrated an increase in hair growth; Finasteride, a medicine, stops hair loss by reducing the amount of dht by about 70%. So i could�ve had telogen effluvium which induced my male pattern baldness. After you start using finasteride, you may still continue to lose hair, but at a slower rate than normal. Finasteride.</p>

<p>Scalp hair is rather unique in that it is nonpubertal hair that is not stimulated by testosterone and is thinned by the effect of dht. Dht is believed to act on scalp hair follicles to suppress them and gradually create weaker and smaller hair follicles. Finasteride will lower the tissue dht levels by about 66%. If anything it’s been worse.</p>

<p>Studies show that 1mg finasteride taken daily decreases dht levels on the scalp by about 60 percent to percent — enough to significantly slow, or even stop, hair loss in most men.
