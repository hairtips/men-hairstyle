<p>A nice thick beard adds to your personality and shows the world that maybe your scalp doesn’t have too much hair, but you still can grow hair in other areas! Once hair loss occurs it can take months for hair to grow back, and the growth does not always look encouraging. On close inspection, those with dark hair may be able to discern a shadow or dark spots in their hair follicles. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition that causes hair to fall out suddenly.</p>
<h3 id="hair-grows-back-at-a-rate-of-about-6-inches-per-year">Hair grows back at a rate of about 6 inches per year.</h3><p>Shadow indicates that hair follicles have entered into the anagen, or active, phase of hair growth. However, it may take a while for your hair to achieve its original fullness and length. A dermatologist can also provide hair loss treatment options to individuals who do not want to wait 6 to 9 months for their hair to grow back. Depending on your situation, a number of treatments are available. Well, the duration usually is limited to 1 or 2 months at most, and after that hair grows back again. If we see that our hair falls out more during certain periods of the year, this shouldn´t be a reason to worry about.</p>
