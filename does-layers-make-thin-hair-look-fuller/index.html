<p>The simple answer is yes. While middle parts have their time and place, a deep side part can help make your tresses appear fuller. Layers are an easy way to get fullness, if you follow these golden rules. If your hair is thinning, parts of your scalp are probably visible. Layers are a great way to change up a look,.</p>
