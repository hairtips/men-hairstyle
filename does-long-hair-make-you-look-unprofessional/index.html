Unprofessional Hairstyles 30 Styles to Avoid From youprobablyneedahaircut.com</p>

But most of them compensate with extra attention to detail in their professional dress. This question hits near and dear to my heart because, as i’ve mentioned a few times, the older i get, the curlier/wavier my hair gets. I know a lot of other sources say that long hair is unprofessional — it makes young women look younger, and older women are too old for long hair.</p>

So, unless you are going out to cut down many trees, the mountain man beard look is not what you want when you are going for an interview.
