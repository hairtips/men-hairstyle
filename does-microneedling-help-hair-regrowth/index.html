Microneedling involves the use of a dermaroller featuring small needles that cause superficial injuries to the skin. When microneedling is utilized as an adjunct therapy for alopecia, results present an increase in hair density, thickness, and the quality of hair regrowth. however, further research and studies are required to determine if microneedling is as effective as a standalone therapy for alopecia, she notes. Microneedling works by increasing the permeability of topical treatments, helping with the formation of new capillary networks for better blood circulation, and activating various growth. Microneedling followed by growth factor application resulted in an average hair count of 52.91 following growth factor use while microneedling alone was 45.91, in one study. It’s thought that this can result in new hair growth, or perhaps, it may thicken thinning hair as seen in androgenic alopecia or male pattern baldness.</p>
