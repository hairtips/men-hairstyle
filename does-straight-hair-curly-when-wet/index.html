<p>It is a must for them. Just as curly hairs typically curl the most when wet, humidity in the air brings out waves or curls in hair. I have straight hair and my 3 yr old son does too. Your curls can and probably will change over time. It’s easy to disrupt natural waves before they dry.</p>

<p>When your hair gets wet, the water molecules are attracted to the oppositely charged ions on your hair strands. I also used the scraps of tissue (one centimetre each) and test the amount of the static electricity. So if you lived in a desert your whole life and suddenly moved to a humid area like the southern us, for example,.</p>

<p>This is normally because the water makes your hair heavy and stretched, so it dries straight. Curly hair looks straight when wet, because it gets heavier when it’s wet. Use an elastic band to hold each ponytail in place. Detangling your hair makes it easier to braid and will get you neater results. I have straight hair and my 3.</p>
