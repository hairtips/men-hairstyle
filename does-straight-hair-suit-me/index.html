<p>It’s kind of a given that if you’ve got curly hair, you wish you had straight hair, and if you have straight hair you wish it was curly. This does not mean you can�t have short hair. There are also a lot of different ways people use to figure this out. If you don�t have straight hair don�t worry!</p>
<h3 id="darker-warm-red-and-warm-brown-hair-perfectly-suits-this-type-copper-chestnut-brown">Darker warm red and warm brown hair perfectly suits this type (copper, chestnut brown).</h3><p>I like the way it suits me and i like the feel of it on my shoulders and/ or chest. I think i fall into the warm category. Straight down the middle doesn�t work for everyone, but you also don�t want to have a severe side part either, sam villa show ambassador, marissa villa told the list. I had no idea that how you part your hair could age you. Warmer hair colors look the best with warm skin tones, and they�ll brighten up your skin. It’s kind of a given that if you’ve got curly hair, you wish you had straight hair, and if you have straight hair you wish it was curly.</p>
