<p>The thin layers will look full and natural because of how thin they are. Layers remove weight, which adds volume. When thin hair grows super long, it has a tendency to look extra fine and stringy towards the ends. This layered look that piles on top of the head will make any head of thin hair appear thicker and more.</p>
