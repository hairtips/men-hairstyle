<p>Write down these four measurements. This will lengthen how your face looks. That way, you can easily determine the widest part of your face. We suggest asking a friend, looking in the mirror, or taking a selfie.</p>
<h3 id="measure-straight-down-from-the-middle-of-your-hairline-down-to-the-very-bottom-of-your-chin-and-note-down-that-measurement">Measure straight down from the middle of your hairline down to the very bottom of your chin and note down that measurement.</h3><p>The best way to do this is by creating a curved brow, which will lift your face upwards, making it appear more round. Don’t be afraid to lengthen your brow, as it’ll help balance a sharper jawline. If you have a heart face shape…your forehead is wider than your jawline and chin. If you have an inverted triangle face shape, your forehead is the widest part of your face, tapering down to a narrower, pointy chin. They are larger than forehead and jawline, which also have a similar measurement. Measure the distance along the edge of your jaw until you reach the middle of your chin.</p>
