<p>Blame it on the weather! Curls can suffer too, especially from lack of moisture leading to dried tresses. Hard water caused my curly hair to have dryness, damage, breakage, build up, and frizz. Alternatively, you can have 60% humidity in 70°f/21°c weather and your curly hair could be full of frizz!</p>
<h3 id="knowing-how-your-skin-and-hair-adapt-or-dont-to-the-cold-is-helpful">Knowing how your skin and hair adapt, or don’t, to the cold is helpful.</h3><p>Embrace your hair accept it for what. Blame it on the weather! Straight hairs tunnel vertically down into your scalp, while curly hairs tunnel in at an angle. Making curly, natural hair workable is a question of lifestyle, first and foremost. Since there is so much moisture in the air when it is humid, dry hair will begin forming bonds as quickly as possible, which causes countless hydrogen bonds to form between hydrogen molecules, causing the keratin proteins in the center of your hair to fold over on themselves, bulging the outer layer of the hair, and eventually breaching the cuticle. Hair changes length with increases in humidity, so curly hair frizzes and straight hair goes limp.</p>
