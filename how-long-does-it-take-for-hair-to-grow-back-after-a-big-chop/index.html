<p>This rate is an average across races. For hair up to your shoulder blades, it will take 34 months of growing. I now wear a short almost shaved cut. Hair typically grows half an inch each month.</p>
<h3 id="for-chin-length-hair-you-will-need-to-wait-18-months">For chin length hair, you will need to wait 18 months.</h3><p>At first, though, the teeny weeny afro will be your only choice. After a few months, your options will increase as your hair has some new growth. (if you had a texturizer instead of a relaxer, the difference probably won�t be as noticeable.) In lower doses of radiation, the hair will generally grow back in 3 to 6 months after the final radiation session. My husband says to never go back to hair. My hair constantly changes as it grows.</p>

<p>My hair constantly changes as it grows. I didn�t get curls until about 3 or 4 months (if that). I wouldn�t be so concerned about a curl. Should i just bite the bullet and do the chop, are there specific products recommended for damaged texturized hair. In lower doses of radiation, the hair will generally grow back in 3 to.</p>
