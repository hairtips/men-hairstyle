<p>One of the common questions for people curious about their dreadlock progression timeline is, ��how long should dreads be after a year?�� due to the different hair types, it is not easy to give a specific length that should be achieved within 12 months.

<p>Depending on a lot of things mine shrank to about half the length. Mature dreadlocks are tightly knotted and you. You can use a hand held hair dryer to remove any leftover moisture from dreading. How long does it take to grow long hair? Straight hair can be a lot harder to dreadlock than other hair textures.</p>

<p>Interlocking dreads is a maintenance method that involves pulling the end of the dreadlock back through the base of the root. Step 1, get a metal comb. Initially, they take just a short time to install, and then you’ll let time work its magic. It may take some experimentation with a variety of techniques and require lots of patience, but.</p>

<p>Mine shrunk a little bit when starting them, after about 2 months the loops and lumps made them a tiny bit shorter, after they locked up and got a little.

<p>You�ll also need to moisturize them from time to time with dread butta so they don�t get too dry. After a few weeks of growth you will see a lot of progress, continue to use the dread sponge as a brush until the locks are to long for it. I have 4c hair and when i tried waves, it took.</p>
