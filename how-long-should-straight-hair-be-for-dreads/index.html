<p>In straight hair, it might take a minimum of a year for the locs to start to come together. Leave your freeform dreads down and show off your intricate style. But obviously the sooner you start, the sooner your dreadlocks will have matured, and even if you wait for your hair to grown longer before starting they�ll still shrink. This.</p>

<p>Most people that have never been around or had dreads themselves think dreads go right down to the scalp. Depending on your hair type, growing dreads may be more of a challenge. This is an important stage when it comes to dreading your hair. If you are planning on twisting your own locs, your hair needs to be at least.</p>

<p>If you are planning on twisting your own locs, your hair needs to be at least 6 to 8 inches (15 cm) if your hair is straight. Long and flowing freeform dreads. If you�re new to the world of dreadlocks—or locs, as they�re often called—then you need to know what you�re dealing with before deciding that they�re the hair leap.</p>

<p>One or two inch sections are ideal. The downside is that it can take quite a while to backcomb longer hair, especially if you are making smaller sections and doing lots of. Most people try to wait until they get about two or three inches, because you also want to consider the look when you�re. Constantly pulling the hair in.</p>

<p>You should also maintain a regular deep. Continue until you have sectioned through all of your hair. However, it is something you should do at least once a week.
