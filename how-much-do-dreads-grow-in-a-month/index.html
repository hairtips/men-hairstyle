<p>The dreadlock growth stages you can expect while the exact timeline that your hair will take to lock will vary, here are the stages of the loc journey that you can predictably expect. That equates to six inches per year. 1/2″ per month is about average. Contrary to popular belief clean dreads lock up and tighten faster than dirty dreads.</p>
<h3 id="washing-your-dreads-prevents-oil-buildup-on-your-scalp-or-loose-dirty-dreads">Washing your dreads prevents oil buildup on your scalp or loose, dirty dreads.</h3><p>You should also maintain a regular deep conditioning routine, preferably every two weeks. Dreadlocks don’t need to be brushed and don’t require regular trimming. Don’t blame yourself for not growing your hair as quickly as expected. Hair grows around half an inch every month on average. When we say “fully mature,” we are referring to the rooted stage (also called the adult stage), where all of your locs are fully formed, closed at the ends, and have considerable length. You can begin your starter locks with as little as an inch of hair (that’s two months of growth, on average) with certain methods.</p>
