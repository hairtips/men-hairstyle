<p>Just ask the barber to fuck my shit up. When you ask for a taper cut, on the other hand, there are no different names for different taper cuts, so you should simply know how short or long you want the sides to be left.

<p>You could ask them to scissor it shorter if you want to maintain the style, or you could ask for a buzz or a fade if you want it real short (they’ll probably ask you for a guard number which is gonna be a length, so looking up pictures of what those look like might help), or you could get.</p>

<p>Choppy hair occurs when the barber uses point cutting. So i go in to the same shop a couple months later (hair�s pretty long at this point), get a different stylist, and she asks me what i want. Establish the style’s mood with keywords. I�ve had the same haircut for over 20 years. Instead, discuss what aspects of the hairstyle.</p>

<p>Posted by 7 minutes ago. When you need a bit of volume to your hair, ask for choppy. With it being undercut, you�re gonna need to wait for it to grow out or have them blend it higher in the top. You could ask them to scissor it shorter if you want to maintain the style, or you could ask.</p>

<p>So i go in to the same shop a couple months later (hair�s pretty long at this point), get a different stylist, and she asks me what i want. Barbers are used to dealing with people who are unsure, so if it makes you more comfortable then you can bring a picture in of what you want, or just ask.</p>

<p>There first picture, that side is undercut / disconnected. For instance, high ,mid or low fade. Knowing the most commonly used hair terminology I do this all the time, since i sometimes don’t know all the haircutting terminology. You can ask for the haircut you want by envisioning what you want before your appointment and consulting with your stylist before.</p>
