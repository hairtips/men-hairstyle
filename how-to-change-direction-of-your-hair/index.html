<p>You could take the help of beard balms and oils and apply these to help hydrate and style your beard. Put the product on your comb and start running.

You might try dampening the beard and then brushing it out in the desired direction while using a hair dryer. Brush or comb.</p>

<p>We will not be wrong to say that using a brush to train your beards is one of the crucial steps to changing the direction in which your beards grow temporarily. Holding your curling iron vertically or horizontally, plus the way you twist it, can really change your look. The direction in which the cowlick spirals can actually tell you.</p>

<p>If your hair could settle in the new direction without converting back to its original direction, water alone is enough to do the job. It would be so much easier to shave =p.

<p>Split each of the 3 sections into smaller sections about the width of your roller and no more than 2 inches thick. Secure the hair between 2 fingers. Specifically your neck, chin, left cheek, right cheek, and under your nose. I�m not a beard guy, so i�ll let others chime in with their experiences. Once you have the correct beard.</p>
