<p>Put hair ties on each section at the length you want to trim it. Dry curl cuts are basically cutting hair when it is dry instead of when it is wet. Instead of trying to make layers that are perfectly even as you would do on someone with straight hair, dry curl cuts create layers based on your natural curl.</p>

The cc1 technique, also called the curl cutting technique, was only created in 2019 and therefore is a relatively new cutting technique.
