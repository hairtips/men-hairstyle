<p>Now run your hands through your hair and look at what you have. You can do this by imagining you�ve been electrified. Brush forward the remaining two thirds of your hair into a reverse ponytail and cut your hair straight across. Start by scooping up a large section of hair on the very top of the head. Make a top.</p>

<p>Now run your hands through your hair and look at what you have. It is next to impossible to cut hair with a set of clippers if the hair is soaking wet, and wet hair can also cause the blades of your hair clippers to rust. It determines where the shortest layer falls. Below are my step by step instructions,.</p>

<p>Bring that entire portion of your hair forward and tie a ponytail just above the crown of your head. This is where the angle you hold the section comes into play. The more wet the hair is the easier it will be to cut. Cut just the top and around the crown of the head for now. Leave your hair.</p>

<p>Imagine what you want the result to. Bring that entire portion of your hair forward and tie a ponytail just above the crown of your head. Start to include more hair from your clipped up section and repeat the process taking one inch slices and combing the hair straight down. Many graduated cuts also have a stacked area around the.</p>

<p>Cut this hair at an angle, creating a smooth, gradual line from the long hair to the short hair.
