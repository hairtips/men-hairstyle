<p>Cutting your hair with hair clippers may not be as challenging as you thought, especially if you’re willing to put some effort into it. For the bottom of my hairline, the sideburns, and around the ears i will use a #2 guard. If you have longer, curly hair you might want to use a comb and scissors, taking small sections.</p>

<p>Using your hair clippers or a razor, cut your sideburns beginning from the bottom to the top to your desired length. Place your fingers below each sideburn to make sure they are the same length. My oldest boy has super straight hair and keeps his cut short, so i usually buzz the sides &amp; back with the clippers (guard size.</p>

<p>Use the same guard length for the entire head for standard length. Or cut hair in the bathroom. These do the bulk of the work for you. When using your clippers, try to go in the opposite direction, so you’ll move up the sides and the back. Place your fingers below each sideburn to make sure they are the same.</p>

<p>This is optional unless you cut your hair. Cut the major length off. These do the bulk of the work for you. It’s always a good idea to cut against the direction of your hair growth. These can keep your hair out of the way.</p>

<p>Usually, hair grows down the sides and back. If your hair is fairly long in the back, it can be difficult to take all of the necessary hair for the undercut off with your clippers. For the final trim around the ears, the neckline, and the sideburns i will just freehand it with no guard. Pulling the lever in a.</p>

<p>If you have longer, curly hair you might want to use a comb and scissors, taking small sections and lifting the hair between your fingers to the length you want, trimming off the excess. Blend as best as you can. In fact, wet hair is harder to cut. Cut the major length off. When using your clippers, try to go.</p>

<p>Leaving it “open” will allow for longer cutting lengths. You set it up and start following one of my haircut guides on wisebarber. Equal amounts of pressure should be applied with every pass. If playback doesn�t begin shortly, try restarting your device. Place your fingers below each sideburn to make sure they are the same length.</p>

<p>I try to avoid leaving obvious lines of transition from one length to another. Slicing your hair with the clipper: To get started, part your hair on one side of your head where you usually part it, which should be in line with where the side of your hair meets your front hairline. Remember, the metal face of the trimmer.</p>
