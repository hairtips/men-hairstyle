<p>To create a perm, a stylist wraps hair around rods, also called perm rollers, and applies a chemical solution that changes. After you rinse out the perm solution, you neutralize and you either twist or dry depending on what type of style you are doing afterwards, but that is pretty much the process of doing a dread perming. One variation.</p>

<p>Latching is my choice way up loc upkeep as it is more permanent than and twisting. A perm, also known as a permanent wave, is the process of chemically altering the structure of your hair from straight to curly. A perm kit may be used very differently for different purposes. Most perms last between three and six months. Be sure.</p>

<p>This is usually “recommended” (not by me, of course!) on stubbornly straight, silky hair like asian hair. Continue twisting down to the ends of each section of hair. Don’t go into it without considering your options and the state of your hair. You need to make sure that the shampoo that you’re choosing doesn’t have “sulfate” in it! You’ll repeat.</p>

<p>How to go from a perm to dreadlocks : The products you used before may not work for your permed hair. After washing your hair with that first product, use a moisturizing product to keep hair healthy and manageable. You can keep the permed hair at the end of the natural hair that is coming in and try to minimize.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://hairtips.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d4/23/c5/d423c5a81412d3160c776e4c938c6509.jpg" alt="Pin by raditya putra on perming Permed hairstyles, Tight" title="Pin by raditya putra on perming Permed hairstyles, Tight" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https:\/\/hairtips.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg';" class="center" />

Each individual section is then backcombed, or teased, to knot the hair and create a dreadlock shape. To relax a perm that is too curly, you have to start by washing your hair. The part of the hair where the natural hair joins.</p>
