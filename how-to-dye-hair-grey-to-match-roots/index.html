<p>Rinse your hair with cool water and style as usual. The hardest part of transitioning to gray hair is growing out your roots.

Rinse your hair with cool water and style as usual.</p>
<h3 id="consider-doing-only-your-roots">Consider doing only your roots:</h3><p>If you’re using a normal shampoo, grab one without sulfates as they will strip the colour out slowly. Add a neutral pigment to your hair dye color if you have gray roots. You have the option of essentially getting a color correction, but instead of correcting it your natural or dyed color, your colorists correct it to be more like the gray shade growing in. To prevent this from happening, apply the box dye to the gray roots for 20 minutes, then apply the dye at the hair length and wait for another 10 minutes to get a seamless blend. I like to use a hair dye brush that makes it really easy to just color my roots. Most shampoos “for coloured hair” should work, but keep in mind that it will still fade regardless of the shampoo you use.</p>
