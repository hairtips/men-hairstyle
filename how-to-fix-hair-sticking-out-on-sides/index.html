<p>For us asians, this shouldn’t take too long, because our hair shafts are thicker and therefore heavier. Try using a strong hold clay. Then you can style the top with curling or straight irons, use a bit of water though to bring back the volume. When the hair is dry, go back into the section and detail the hair so.</p>

<p>Arruntegui advises starting with a fresh slate: Simply part your bangs wherever you�d like and grab a small piece of the bangs nearest to the part. Also, if you sleep on your hair pressed down, when you wake up it should be flatter. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the other side of the part. Then, comb your sideburns up.</p>

<p>You love your short hair… When the hair is dry, go back into the section and detail the hair so it blends with the rest of the haircut.
