<p>Growing out my pixie cut: This will keep you out of the mullet zone unless that’s what you’re going for. While you can’t magically speed up your hair growth, growing out your mullet is entirely possible with a combination of patience and the right hair styling plan. The best way to stop a mullet from growing out a pixie cut is to keep the hair trimmed at the back of your neck while leaving the top alone.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-stage-of-the-journey-your-allies-will-be-styling-products-and-your-creativity-to-style-your-hair">The first stage of the journey, your allies will be styling products and your creativity to style your hair.</h3><p>Make sure they know you are trying to grow it out! Having a pixie cut is not as low maintenance as commonly thought, because you have to get it trimmed and keep the back of your neck shaved to keep it from looking like an ‘80s mullet. The key to growing a mullet is to start off with your hair long. It should be at least one inch long all the way around. Carefully tug at the twist to give it some thickness and make it. Trim the back theres a good chance youll end up with a hockey mullet during the growth phase since hair sprouts lower from the back of the head than it does from the front.</p>
