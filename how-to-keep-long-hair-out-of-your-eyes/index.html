<p>The goal is to keep your pup�s facial hair trimmed back out of his eyes and to be able to do so without either of you becoming stressed out. Begin by choosing the direction you would like your hair to flow. Move your face close to the stream of water, and tilt your head so the stream from the faucet washes over your eye. The shih tzu�s hair is a double coat that tangles easily and can lead to matting.</p>
<h3 id="flush-the-surface-of-the-eye-until-the-hair-is-gone">Flush the surface of the eye until the hair is gone.</h3><p>Check in the mirror every five minutes or so to see if it is out. This one works for any type of hair, but is particularly useful for ladies growing out bangs. Begin by choosing the direction you would like your hair to flow. Make a diagonal part, beginning from the outer edge of your fringe, toward the middle of your head. Use your fingers or a comb to pull the nose bridge hairs upward. Keeping your dog�s hair groomed and trimmed is part of pet care, but just as with people, those bangs may need a trim in between official appointments.</p>
