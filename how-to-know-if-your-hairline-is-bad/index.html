<p>Not all men’s hairlines proceed through this normal process of ‘maturation’ but most do. One test your doctor may perform is called a “pull test”. Next, comb all of the hair back, towards the crown (top) of your head. If you have chances of female pattern baldness, you may experience thin hair and a making your hairline look weak and volume less.</p>
<h3 id="your-hair-is-actually-thinning-and-experiencing-hair-loss">Your hair is actually thinning and experiencing hair loss.</h3><p>You will feel that your hairline does not have any density like it used to. A tiny crack in the flyback can cause arcing. But if you’re noticing smaller, lighter hairs beyond the front edge of your hairline, it’s possible you’re balding. While there aren’t official statistics to confirm its prevalence, it is estimated that well over 90% of white men will have a mature hairline in the second half of their lives. To determine whether or not you’ve got an early receding hairline, grab a comb with fine teeth. Nearly everyone has small “baby” or vellus hairs at the front part of their hairline.</p>
