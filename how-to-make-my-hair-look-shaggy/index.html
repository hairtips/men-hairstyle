This shag cut is a good choice of hairdo for ladies with a straight face, and it makes your face looks slimmer and younger. Use a brush to blow dry bangs down and blow dry hair straight, brushing hair downwards and inwards near hair ends. If your hair is very thin, be sure to have your stylist texture only the ends so they do not remove too much hair.</p>
<h3 id="trim-your-hair-in-short-vertical-or-angled-motions-so-you-can-create-a-balanced-feathery-effect-along-the-edge-of-your-shaggy-bangs">Trim your hair in short, vertical or angled motions so you can create a balanced, feathery effect along the edge of your shaggy bangs.</h3><p>Unlike other wavy haircuts, you don’t need to have much to maintain the hairdo. These bangs with shag work on the face shape unless you mess them up with your fingers to give them some separation. Rub the pomade or wax on your fingertips to apply to your hair. First things first, the shag hairstyle is all about texture. Doing this will provide more volume and messy texture. There�s no need for pin straight hair or perfect parts, and oftentimes the unrulier the hair the better.</p>
