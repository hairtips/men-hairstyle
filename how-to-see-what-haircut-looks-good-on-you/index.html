Look, inspiration photos are great and we always recommend bringing a few to your stylist for reference. Wavy hair tends to look best with most haircuts because it has volume and movement.</p>
<h3 id="all-you-have-to-do-is-upload-your-photo-to-see-how-youd-look-in-any-hairstyle-or-cut-that-piques-your-interest">All you have to do is upload your photo to see how you’d look in any hairstyle or cut that piques your interest.</h3><p>“if you agree on cutting a half inch off of your ends, ask if you can show them on their comb what you believe a half inch is and see if they agree,” says carruthers. To find out if a short haircut looks good with your face, simply measure the distance between the earlobe and chin. As a short sides, longer top haircut, you’ll need 2 to 3 inches of length on top that tapers down to a close bald fade on the sides and toward the nape of the neck. I ain�t never look this fresh before. Or it might give you the confidence to try a bold new haircut that you never thought would look good on you! Choosing a new hairstyle and knowing how it will look without the risk of cutting your hair has never been easier!</p>
