Shaving my head during Chemo YouTube From youtube.com</p>
<p>After you shave your head, take extra special care of your scalp to keep it healthy. It worked for the first cycle but by the second one, a lot was coming out on top so i decided to bite the bullet and get my head shaved. My mom lost all her hair with her first chemo and no she never shaved her hair and it grew in so soft and curly. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<h3 id="because-i-started-out-blogging-about-my-breast-cancer-experience-on-a-site-called-caringbridge-i-never-really-shared-what-i-went-through-with-my-chemotherapy-treatments-on-this-blog">Because i started out blogging about my breast cancer experience on a site called caringbridge, i never really shared what i went through with my chemotherapy treatments on this blog.</h3><p>Although shaving your own head is easy once you learn how to do, it may take time for you to perfect your technique. I never had this before the chemo. However, more importantly, the chemo may also have made the scalp more sensitive and susceptible to irritation. Consider using a gentle shampoo. Because of this, fully shaving the scalp may result in added irritation once the hair starts to grow back in and emerge through the scalp. I just shaved my head today.</p>

<p>Again, this is a very personal decision but i wanted to remain in control. It was aweful for all.

<p>She always had straight hair but wanted curly so i guess the cancer gave her that much for about a year then the 4th line chemo took most of her hair once again so she died with just a few tufts left.

<p>It was more traumatic for me to sit and watch my hair fall out. “sure,” i said, even though, despite the two years plus i’ve spent in oncology nursing, i had yet to shave anyone’s head. About a week later my head was covered (no room for another)in what looked like chicken pox blisters without the fluid. This then gave.</p>

<p>However, more importantly, the chemo may also have made the scalp more sensitive and susceptible to irritation. I woke up a couple of days later and i couldn’t bear the itch any longer. I�m about 11 weeks after my last chemo.taxol and carboplatin.i have a pretty good fuzz on my head, and i am back to shaving my legs and.</p>

<p>Stephanie kindly shaving my head on april 22, 2009. I found that combing it several times a day, especially before bed, in the am, before showering worked well. However, more importantly, the chemo may also have made the scalp more sensitive and susceptible to irritation. Other posts about chemo you might want to read: I knew it was going to.</p>

<p>It’s your hair, it’s your cancer and it’s your decision. Do not color or get a perm during chemotherapy. She always had straight hair but wanted curly so i guess the cancer gave her that much for about a year then the 4th line chemo took most of her hair once again so she died with just a few tufts.</p>

<p>The extent of hair loss depends on the type of chemo, as well as the dose, but you can generally expect to regrow an inch of hair about two months after you stop treatment, followed by a full head. My hairstylist told me to simply shave my hair. Your scalp will drink it down. It�s the same color as the.</p>

<p>Again, this is a very personal decision but i wanted to remain in control. Try using coconut oil on your head. Because i started out blogging about my breast cancer experience on a site called caringbridge, i never really shared what i went through with my chemotherapy treatments on this blog. Rinse out the conditioner, dry your hair and now.</p>

<p>Shave i recommend shaving as soon as you see it falling out. First, the chemo has affected your scalp and hair follicles causing the loss of most of your hair. The day i shaved my head because i had cancer. I went into my bathroom at around 5:30am. I never had this before the chemo.</p>
