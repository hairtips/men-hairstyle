<p>My ethos really is, life�s too short! If something fits your body properly, you shouldn�t have to pull, tug, readjust frequently.

<p>If you feel self conscious when you dress, avoid wearing clothing with large prints, and wear vertical stripes to make you look taller. If you’re worried about your skirt blowing up, you can also wear spandex shorts underneath for extra security.
