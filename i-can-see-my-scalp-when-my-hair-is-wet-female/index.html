<p>Unwanted hair growth may occur in areas adjacent to treatment sites, which can be little distressing to women when the face is involved. I then use a pick to fluff up and mostly cover any scalp left (dark hair + pale skin makes it much more visible too imo). If it’s more than an inch you are almost certainly going bald. This is why prioritizing your hair and scalp health is so important, as hair loss can affect virtually anyone.</p>
