<p>Is cutting hair a sin in sikhism? Kesh combined with the combing of hair using a kangha shows respect for god and all of his gifts. Dishonouring one�s hair is one of the four bajjar kurehats (cardinal sins), which the guru has told a sikh never to commit. Since 1699, about two centuries after the founding of the religion, sikh leaders have prohibited their members from cutting their hair, saying long hair is a symbol of sikh pride.</p>
<h3 id="however-all-sikhs-should-ultimately-work-towards-becoming-khalsa">However, all sikhs should ultimately work towards becoming khalsa.</h3><p>The most revered sikh symbol is hair.

In my opinion, as a practicing sikh, keeping your hair is one of the simplest aspects of following sikhism, and doesn’t measure much. People often confuse the role of a sikh and that of a khalsa, they are similar in many aspects, however they are not the same. So yes, you are still a sikh if you cut your hair.</p>
