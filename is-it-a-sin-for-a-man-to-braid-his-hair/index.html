<h3 id="1-ti-29-do-not-change-the-natural-state-of-your-hair-in-any-way">(1 ti 2:9) do not change the natural state of your hair in any way.</h3><p>He says, “if you say they are both based on god’s created design, then you have to say long hair is wrong for men in every culture.” in other words, if they have the same meaning, and they refer to god’s created design, then you have to say that long hair on men and short hair on women are always wrong in every culture without exception. The same is applicable to their beards. In fact, the bible encourages it. Yes, it is sin to braid your hair. If you change it (with hair dye, hair perm, or wear artificial hair), your name is removed from the book of life. This hair style does not stop water from reaching the scalp at all.</p>
