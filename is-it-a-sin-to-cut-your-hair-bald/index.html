It bear a cultural meaning and did not indicate a condition of sinfulness before god but a condition, often punishment for a crime, before society. What does hair symbolize in the bible? I believe it is a sin, because your body is a gift from god.</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-see-why-it-would-be-a-sin-for-one-to-shave-and-not-the-other">I don’t see why it would be a sin for one to shave and not the other.</h3><p>And even then, you can still cut it and bear the burden of the sin. You shall not cut yourselves nor shave the front of your head for the dead. This belief comes from two passages from 1 corinthians 11, which read: 40 and the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; Their hair could not be too short either and they could not be bald. It seems like if shaving off hair was was against what god wanted for us, it would be true for men and women</p>
