<h3 id="if-it-was-inherently-damaging-they-wouldn039t-have-had-long-hair">If it was inherently damaging, they wouldn�t have had long hair.</h3><p>(ponytail migraines are the worst, aren’t they?) you can also twirl. In other words, yes—your ponytail can cause hair loss. And yes, this policy applies to buns, too. This usually results in not being able to touch your head for a couple seconds followed by a full on head massage.

This is should not be too tight and a fabric based hair tie is ideal to reduce friction and damage.</p>
