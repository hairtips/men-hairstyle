You Should Be Sleeping With Your Hair In A Bun Every Night From pinterest.com</p>
<p>After all, night time is for sleeping and so your body can rest. Crushing your hair with the weight of your head can leave curls looking matted and messy. No matter what length your hair is, using a silk pillowcase can keep your hair healthy and reduce friction at bedtime. This way, there is less friction between your hair and the pillowcase.</p>
<h3 id="sleeping-with-curly-hair-is-easy-when-you-add-these-to-your-curly-girl-nighttime-routine-and-wake-up-to-less-frizzy-and-more-defined-curls">Sleeping with curly hair is easy when you add these to your curly girl nighttime routine and wake up to less frizzy and more defined curls.</h3><p>This way, there is less friction between your hair and the pillowcase. Sure, it’s a unique nighttime look, but if it makes for better hair by day, who cares? If you have short curly hair, you can do your own version of the pineapple by tying your hair up in multiple smaller ponytails on top of your head. Sleeping with your hair down seems like the most natural way to go but can actually be doing more harm than good, especially if you have long hair. To combat this, try wrapping your hair in a silk scarf or sleeping on a silk pillowcase, which will help preserve your curl pattern and reduce the amount of friction they’re exposed to throughout the night. Irrespective of whether you are sleeping with dry or wet hair, having a silk pillow is a must.</p>
