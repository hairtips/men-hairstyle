<p>Red can give way to blond. If your baby was born with hair, you may find that it starts falling out from about two months to six months, but after this it should start growing back again (ginta and gill 2016). Baby hair dos are hair today, bad hair day (gone) tomorrow! Whether you have a calm baby or a fussy one, you’ll start to get used to all the variations of those little whimpers and wails this first month.</p>
<h3 id="during-the-resting-stage-the-hair-remains-in-the-follicle-until-the-new-hair-starts-coming-in">During the resting stage, the hair remains in the follicle until the new hair starts coming in.</h3><p>This kind of hair loss is called telogen effluvium. This baby hair is then replaced by permanent hair. Your toddler might also lose hair due to hormone imbalance. The growth stage lasts about three years, and the resting stage lasts about three months (although anywhere from one to six months is normal). Almost all newborns lose some or all of their hair before the mature hair follicles erupt (1). Hair has a growth stage and a resting stage.</p>
