<p>My dd who is 11 has/had hairy legs and has done for a few years now but it was only this year that it really started to bother her. As your child approaches kindergarten, they may be more likely to be aware of and agree to rules. It sounds as if he has quite a high circulating level of testosterone. Lifemeasure�s length charts for infant boys and male height charts for all ages is the easy way to track and compare growth trends.</p>
<h3 id="my-dd-is-4-and-has-quite-hairy-legs">My dd is 4 and has quite hairy legs!</h3><p>All kids will grow hair on their arms &amp; legs, it will just look different depending on their heritage. I assume that she has a little bit more testosterone than a 5 years old girl. The hair on her legs is very thick and coarse, prickly to touch. Feel blessed that it�s light in color! I�m probably a similar colouring to your dd as are my sisters and we all had black hairy legs, mine is worse near the bottom of my legs but blondish on my thighs. I don�t think it has anything to do with additional hormones, i think it�s just there or it isn�t.</p>

<p>The hair on her arms is very noticeable. She is 46 inches and weighs about 60lbs. This year, kids’ ability to think and learn reaches beyond the basics of the world around them. I have a daughter who has just turned four. It sounds as if he has quite a high circulating level of testosterone.</p>

<p>Even my 4 year old has hairy legs, not serious hair, but it�s dark, and there. If they are early then they should probably go in to get a checkup as it could be a sign of precocious puberty. She has 2 older sisters so she is much more advanced than most 6 year olds. They are mixed and it�s.</p>

<p>Just address the issue if it comes up from her. Any advice?i dont think a 5 year old should start waxing or shaving.i have reassured her that its normal for little girls to have hair on their legs. My five year old daughter is very hairy. I don�t think it has anything to do with additional hormones, i think it�s.</p>

<p>Many kids have hairs on the legs, but some are very noticable to the point it is a problem. Feel blessed that it�s light in color! It’s normal for girls to start developing things like pubic hair, body odor, and breasts before the age of 8. For boys, that is a little more unusual. If they are early then they.</p>

<p>Both of my girls are hairy. I don�t think it has anything to do with additional hormones, i think it�s just there or it isn�t. As an infant i noticed her hair was very thin and had alot of breakage at the roots. One of my girls also seems to be hairy. All kids will grow hair on their arms.</p>

<p>Let the poor kid shave. At about 18 months, i noticed slight. They start thinking about and understanding things they can’t see or touch. My four year old�s leg hair is so dark you can see it matted through her tights and it has been growing and getting darker since she was born. Emma m (701) 09/09/2009 at 3:42 pm.</p>

<p>Answers from chicago on july 20, 2009. The reason for it is most likely genetics — if you or your child�s other parent had a lot of body hair as a toddler (or someone in either of your families did), your toddler simply inherited the. She also has hair across her lower back. My five year old daughter is very.</p>

My four year old�s leg hair is so dark you can see it matted through her tights and it has been growing and getting darker since she was born. You might notice that kids start to “have an idea” more often than you’d seen.</p>

<p>I am very concerned about my 41/2 year old daughter. If they are early then they should probably go in to get a checkup as it could be a sign of precocious puberty. She also has hair across her lower back. Just address the issue if it comes up from her. Hopefully it fill rub off, they are 3 and.</p>

<p>She has a v of hair from her shoulders down to the middle of her back which is very noticeable. I have a daughter who has just turned four. They start thinking about and understanding things they can’t see or touch. Let the poor kid shave. For boys, that is a little more unusual.</p>

<p>For boys, that is a little more unusual. It’s normal for girls to start developing things like pubic hair, body odor, and breasts before the age of 8. Pubic hair on 4 year old girl. My ds had a spate of leg ache when he was 4 (nearly 5) touch wood nothing recently. Boys continue to fill out with muscle.</p>

<p>When she was younger she had a really hairy back as well but less so now. If they are early then they should probably go in to get a checkup as it could be a sign of precocious puberty. All kids will grow hair on their arms &amp; legs, it will just look different depending on their heritage. I�m probably.</p>

<p>She has 2 older sisters so she is much more advanced than most 6 year olds. When she was younger she had a really hairy back as well but less so now. I assume that she has a little bit more testosterone than a 5 years old girl. My ds had a spate of leg ache when he was 4.</p>

<p>My dd is 4 and has quite hairy legs! This year, kids’ ability to think and learn reaches beyond the basics of the world around them. The hair on her legs is very thick and coarse, prickly to touch. They are mixed and it�s also dark brown hair. Yes, my daughter is also very hairy, both arms and legs.</p>

<p>She is 46 inches and weighs about 60lbs. I noticed that it happened after a long day out or when we had done lots of activity that day/week As your child approaches kindergarten, they may be more likely to be aware of and agree to rules.

<p>For boys, that is a little more unusual. My ds had a spate of leg ache when he was 4 (nearly 5) touch wood nothing recently. It is thick and long and she comments on it often.

<p>This is probably just a normal variation but it might be worth discussing with your gp. I assume that she has a little bit more testosterone than a 5 years old girl. I do the usual , tell her to let people know if they say something to upset her but let her know everyone is different and that this.</p>

<p>Feel blessed that it�s light in color! One of my girls also seems to be hairy. She has 2 older sisters so she is much more advanced than most 6 year olds. He would wake and cry for ages, i would rub his legs and give 2 x spoons of calpol to relieve the pain. Even my 4 year old.</p>

<p>I have a daughter who has just turned four. This is probably just a normal variation but it might be worth discussing with your gp. My dd who is 11 has/had hairy legs and has done for a few years now but it was only this year that it really started to bother her. Emma m (701) 09/09/2009 at 3:42.</p>
