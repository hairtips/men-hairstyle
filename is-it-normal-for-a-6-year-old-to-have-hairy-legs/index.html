<p>Luckily it is almost translucent in color, but it is thick and soft. Let the poor kid shave. I did have a complex about it, but i bet nobody actually even noticed it, and it lightened and thinned out when i reached adulthood.of course if it doesn�t, and it bothers her at that point, there is always waxing. My 6 year old has had some hair growth in the last year or two and it is getting more pronounced.</p>
<h3 id="yes-my-daughter-is-also-very-hairy-both-arms-and-legs">Yes, my daughter is also very hairy, both arms and legs.</h3><p>I see this all the time at the gym: Her oldest sister has hardly any hair at all and her other sister has blond hair so it isn�t very noticeable. My 6 year old has had some hair growth in the last year or two and it is getting more pronounced. It is thick and long and she comments on it often. My 5 almost 6 year old daughter started having body odor when she turned 5. Also a fair bit of armpit hair.</p>

<p>6 year old showing her vagina.

<p>Her oldest sister has hardly any hair at all and her other sister has blond hair so it isn�t very noticeable. Some toddlers have fine, downy hair on the arms, legs, back, or even face.

<p>Also a fair bit of armpit hair. I did have a complex about it, but i bet nobody actually even noticed it, and it lightened and thinned out when i reached adulthood.of course if it doesn�t, and it bothers her at that point, there is always waxing. Babies born early may appear to have. Answers from los angeles on september.</p>

<p>Some toddlers have fine, downy hair on the arms, legs, back, or even face. Body hair is often darker, and therefore more. A ten year old putting his mouth on someone else’s genitals is an infrequent behavior for his age group, but kids can follow through on things they’re wondering about in lots of different ways. Babies born early may.</p>

<p>I did also notice that she had blackheads on her nose, and she did have a couple of pubic hairs. I had reaaallly hairy arms as a kid, and it was fairly dark. I think if it is affecting her that much though, why not let her use some hair removing cream? We started noticing it around 4 months ago.</p>

<p>My daughter who is 6 was at her fathers today when i received a phone call from him saying she had been showing her vagina to her younger 3 year old cousin and trying to look down his trousers.

<p>I suggest you give your daughter options and have her chose. My pediatrician did a blood panel on her for precocious puberty(early puberty) her testosterone levels were elevated just slightly which causes the hair growth and blackheads. Hair is natural, kids shouldn�t need to shave their legs! A ten year old putting his mouth on someone else’s genitals is an.</p>

<p>My 6 year old has quite a bit of peach fuzz on her back. It is an excess of dht that actually causes the hair loss, not the deficiency of testosterone. Her oldest sister has hardly any hair at all and her other sister has blond hair so it isn�t very noticeable. It is most likely that your daughter has.</p>

<p>The reason for it is most likely genetics — if you or your child�s other parent had a lot of body hair as a toddler (or someone in either of your families did), your toddler simply inherited the body hair.

<p>One of the most common in infants is prematurity. Her oldest sister has hardly any hair at all and her other sister has blond hair so it isn�t very noticeable. My 6 year old has quite a bit of peach fuzz on her back. She thinks clothing and accessories worn with hairy legs should match that lifestyle. It is thick.</p>
