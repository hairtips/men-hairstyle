<h3 id="i039ve-heard-about-some-effective-products-for-genetic-hair-loss-like-minoxidil-but-i-did-my-own-digging-and-this-breakdown-of-it-and-this-side-effects-list-scare-me">I�ve heard about some effective products for genetic hair loss like minoxidil, but i did my own digging and this breakdown of it and this side effects list scare me.</h3><p>The hair around your hairline or temples may be shorter where. In my experience, if a man is going to experience balding, you usually see the beginnings of it. Hair loss at the temples can be an early warning sign that you might have male pattern baldness and that your hairline will continue to recede over time. I understand that i might be one of the luckier ones who don�t have any side effects of using this. If male pattern baldness runs in your family, look into (consult a doctor and do research) minoxidil and finasteride to use preventatively. Typically this thinning will start in the temple area.</p>
