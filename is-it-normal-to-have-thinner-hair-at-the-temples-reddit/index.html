<p>I eas concerned that my temples were thinning a bit, but what you gotta realise is your adult hairline is far different than your child hairline.

<p>Hey man, 17 here also. Is it ever normal for temples to have less hair than the rest of your head? Google some male celebrities and look at their hairlines, you�ll probably see that their temple hair is somewhat thinner. Been stressing about my temples for ages now. I have posted pics, and people tell me that it is odd.</p>

<p>Google some male celebrities and look at their hairlines, you�ll probably see that their temple hair is somewhat thinner. Three weeks ago i started taking finasteride (proscar divided in 4) as an attempt to stop further hair loss. No one notices my thinning sides, because i oddly use my thick hair on top to gently cover the sides. Hey man,.</p>

<p>A positive answer suggests a maturing hairline. Hey man, 17 here also.

<p>I noticed today that quite a few younger people have this.even really young kids have much thinner temple hair.which makes me wonder how much mine really has changed in the last few years before i started worrying about it.

<p>A receding hairline, on the other hand, will have a very uneven shape. A combination of dht and testosterone loss can make corner hair thinning worse.
