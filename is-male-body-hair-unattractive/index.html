<p>In the 21st century, a fully bald man can be considered attractive ( the rock and vin diesel are great examples), but the hair loss treatment industry still makes $1 billion each year. Whether it’s social pressure, a barrage of ads for hair removal products, or things like peta’s awful “fur trim unattractive” campaign (which seems to equates having pubic hair with supporting the fur trade?!), many women and girls grow up believing that body hair is unattractive and gross and should be removed from as many places as. I prefer little to no body hair on men. Its impossible to say it just depends on the individual.</p>
<h3 id="in-western-cultures-particularly-america-body-hair-is-associated-with-masculinity">In western cultures, particularly america, body hair is associated with masculinity.</h3><p>The standard of beauty for korean men is a clean complexion, moisturized skin, and free of wrinkles.

I know a lot of people who think that women shouldn�t need to shave it, but know very few who find it to actually be attractive. Out of the 105 women, 78 said they dig it (73%), while 28 (27%) would prefer a hairless man. A man should want to aim high.</p>

<p>I�m not attracted to body hair. A male reader, anonymous, writes (23 october 2008): Back hair is a deal breaker. Its impossible to say it just depends on the individual. Therefore, it stands to reason that a man will improve his sex appeal to women by trimming his body hair.</p>

<p>Women who display masculine traits are not seen as being as attractive as those that only display feminine traits. Mannes’s study in 2012 showed that shaving your head added almost four years to the men’s average age, and the men were viewed as considerably less attractive with shaved heads than with hair. I honestly dont understand why female body hair.</p>

<p>The majority of women favor a man’s butt as her favorite male body part. When did male body hair become a bad thing? I know a lot of people who think that women shouldn�t need to shave it, but know very few who find it to actually be attractive. In the 21st century, a fully bald man can be considered.</p>
