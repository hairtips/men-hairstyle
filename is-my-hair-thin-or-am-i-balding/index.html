In other cases, thinning hair is triggered by something going on inside the body — for instance, a thyroid problem, a shift in hormones, a recent pregnancy, or an inflammatory condition. In order to determine if your hair is thinning or if you are going bald, these are the first 5 questions to ask yourself, as there are a host of factors that can cause hair thinning: If you spot larger amounts of hair coming out than usual when you wash or brush your hair or if there is noticeable thinning or bald spots, this is not likely to be paranoia, but the first signs of hair loss.</p>
