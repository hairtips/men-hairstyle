It�s scientifically proven way to treat hair loss and is cheap &amp; no side effects. Just turned 20 and just realized i am going bald. The hairline is only about one to 1.5 inches above your highest wrinkle.</p>
<h3 id="a-positive-answer-suggests-a-maturing-hairline">A positive answer suggests a maturing hairline.</h3><p>It�s definitely receding, you can see the little hairs on the sides or front of the hairline, those are the balding signs. I�m about to turn 30 and i still have the exact same shape hairline, just really, really slightly thinner on top than it was 10 years ago. Does that mean likely receding hairline? However, if the hairline is very uneven, then it is likely a receding hairline. As discussed, this is a natural process in young men. My dads hair isn�t receding at all and he�s in his mid 40s just has a large widows peek.</p>
