<p>Didn’t do enough plopping but there is a slight wave in the hair. Always detangle when there’s conditioner in your hair. Then wait at least 2 minutes before doing the next step. Hair clumps best when it is soaking wet, so once you are out of the shower, getting wavy hair to clump becomes more difficult.</p>

<p>After you have dried your hair use a silicone based product (to remove fly aways). Recently, my schedule changed up, and i don’t think i’ll be able to sit around with wet hair as often as i do. Towel dry your hair, apply a styling mousse, and then put your hair in four twisted buns. I’ve learned it doesn’t really.</p>

<p>Simply rinsing cold after a nice hot shower is sufficient. I have pretty thick, coarse, wavy hair if it matters. This will help you maintain soft curls for the morning.

<p>After shampooing and conditioning, detangle your hair in the shower. Wash your hair with lukewarm water. Glorious beachy waves start in the shower. This seals the cuticle and adds shine. Didn’t do enough plopping but there is a slight wave in the hair.</p>

<p>Wash your hair with lukewarm water. This, in turn, prevents frizzy hair when you get out of the shower. I think my hair might’ve been too dry when i tried scrunching again a little later on.

<p>Comb through your hair while conditioner is setting in. Using a brush disrupts the natural curl pattern and separates curls which causes frizz. Glorious beachy waves start in the shower. Use a deep hair conditioning mask at least twice a week on clean wet hair to enhance your look. It has worked for me, so i am sure it will.</p>

<p>Right after a shower, your hair strands are saturated with water, which makes them less elastic. This removes the sweat from most of my scalp, but doesn’t make me do a full hair routine.

<p>When combing your hair, use wide tooth comb or gentle brush to avoid hair breakage and comb it in the shower with conditioner. I’ve learned it doesn’t really matter for wavy hair if you detangle dry or detangle wet. So on those days, i put my hair into a bun in the shower, then rinse the edges of my hair..</p>

<p>Use a shampoo designed for daily use. Then apply your conditioner in my case the carrot creme conditioner. After high school all of my friends were going to college. While taking a shower wet your hair with the water and brush it damp. I like to dry detangle with a behairful brush because it’s faster and easier for me.</p>

<p>Squeeze out most of the water from your hair after getting out of the shower and spritz your strands with the vo5 heat protect spray. However, after the shower is not the time to do it. Taking a brush to wet hair literally rips through them, even if you’re being gentle. I have pretty thick, coarse, wavy hair if it.</p>

<p>I have pretty thick, coarse, wavy hair if it matters. Recently, my schedule changed up, and i don’t think i’ll be able to sit around with wet hair as often as i do. (or if it’s day 1, my normal hair care routine). Instead, you can use a wet brush in the shower a few minutes after applying conditioner which.</p>

<p>After you have dried your hair use a silicone based product (to remove fly aways). So on those days, i put my hair into a bun in the shower, then rinse the edges of my hair. Fortunately, you don’t have to take a completely cold shower! This removes the sweat from most of my scalp, but doesn’t make me do.</p>

<p>Use a deep hair conditioning mask at least twice a week on clean wet hair to enhance your look. Instead, you can use a wet brush in the shower a few minutes after applying conditioner which makes detangling so much easier. But after that, really don�t brush anymore. If you have colored hair it could also lead to the loss.</p>

<p>Squeeze out most of the water from your hair after getting out of the shower and spritz your strands with the vo5 heat protect spray. Cut back on hair washes (without losing that clean hair feeling) with a dry shampoo that�s invisible on your roots — absorbing excess oils that. Washing your hair at a low temperature is very good.</p>
