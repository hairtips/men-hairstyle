<p>These hairs are described as coarse and wavy or squiggly. As for the “cause” it is likely simply a matter of genetics. Since your hair follicles aren’t impacted by the position in which you sleep, you don’t need to worry about damaging them or causing hair loss. Hair loss on the sides of the head of a woman often reflects.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it may be a matter of external influences. Dandruff is an uninflamed form of seborrheic dermatitis. I tilt my head to the light and there are big gaps in the hair on the right, and the left is solid. Since your hair follicles aren’t impacted by the position in which you sleep, you don’t need to.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it happens in discrete patches whereas other times it can cover the whole side of your head. The answer is, yes it can. It’s completely normal to have a mix of curl patterns on the same head. Moles and freckles can have different patterns and intensity, and so on. Heavy head, tingling in left leg, left arm, right hand,.</p>

<p>If you have hair on one side of the head that appears to grow longer, faster, stronger, or thicker, it may be a matter of normal variance. Hair follicles are no exception.

<p>Hair follicles are no exception. These hairs are described as coarse and wavy or squiggly. We are talking growth rate here. In your case, it seems to be a matter of differing levels of hair density on one side versus the other. Each hair follicle has its own blood supply, and it’s possible that one side of the head has.</p>

<p>I’m only 21 and i found a single strand of white hair… the weird thing is, the top half of the hair (from roots downwards) is dark brown like the rest of my hair, and only the bottom half. Kelis is the queen of trendsetting. I tilt my head to the light and there are big gaps in the hair.</p>

<p>Lying on one side of your head won’t affect that programming. Scalp massages increase blood circulation to your scalp, strengthen your hair’s roots and helps to evenly distribute your hair’s natural oils (so that your tresses receive more moisture as they experience less breakage)—all of this ultimately leads to a stronger head of hair, on the both sides; One side.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it may be a matter of external influences. Each hair follicle has its own blood supply, and it’s possible that one side of the head has. This means that there are more hairs per square inch of scalp on the “thicker” side, and fewer on the side that “lays flatter”. We do quite frequently see patients.</p>
