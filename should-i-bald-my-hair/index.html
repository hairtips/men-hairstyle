Really insecure about my hair. how short should i go From reddit.com</p>
<p>Honestly, even though i run a hair loss blog, i believe acceptance is the best course for many men. You are one of the thousands of men who experience this dilemma each year. I would get a professional opinion. I would probably go for hair replacement.</p>
<h3 id="i039m-26-years-old-and-have-been-balding-since-about-17">I�m 26 years old and have been balding since about 17.</h3><p>In many cases, bald patches regrow by themselves without treatment. Many men look good bald, as joe rogan says, and the buzzed look has never been cooler. They’ve come a long way from the hideous and conspicuous hair plugs of the 80s, but even now, if they’re done poorly, your results will look unnatural. Never rush into things like cutting your hair when there is a bald spot. You can embrace going bald if you prefer. Not if you are all about dressing your hair.</p>
