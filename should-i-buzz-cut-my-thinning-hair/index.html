<p>Bangs give the illusion of more hair and the emphasis on the hair across your forehead may camouflage the thinning hair closer to your scalp. It’s better to think of a buzz cut as simply a phenomenal style option for a man with thinning hair. It doesn’t mean it’s thinning tho when he gets old it may be a problem..</p>

<p>I have not been under any chronic stress, i exercise and eat healthily. Ok so i like buzz cuts, always have, but there is a little problem concerning me with regards to actually gettin a buzz cut.
