<p>Use a handheld mirror to make sure you haven’t missed any spots. Obviously, i did more work on myself to get here. Be patient, though, girls, because beautiful skin doesn’t happen overnight.

<p>He describes himself as one of those kids who always had hair. Do i really want to give up my hair? After i shaved my head, there was nothing to hide behind anymore. Should i shave my beard? After i quit competing, i continued to shave because i thought my legs looked better without hair.</p>

<p>Now my family hates it, and this doesn�t help. He describes himself as one of those kids who always had hair. Can you do the work? There are a lot of different reasons why every woman should shave her head at least once. And, i’d imagine, way more so than men with obviously.</p>
