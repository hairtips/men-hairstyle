<p>Rocking an undercut is the perfect way to keep your hair off your neck, keeping you looking and feeling cool all day long. Likewise, if the long hair is faded, even a little, into the sides and back, it’s not an undercut. If you have long hair, opting to get rid of some of your length will help to even out your hair more quickly. Start with an undercut pixie that is on the longer side, and then allow your natural curls to tumble down from atop.</p>
<h3 id="get-a-buzz-cut-on-the-sides">Get a buzz cut on the sides.</h3><p>A long undercut is a daring hairstyle that’s for fashionable men that want to keep on top of the latest trends and avoid appearing boring to the rest of the public. The undercut has long been a hair trend since the edwardian era of the 1920s. You achieve the look by shaving down the sides so that they are significantly shorter than the hair up. Adding extra layers into short hair will also hide the short shaved side. If a bold, fresh look is what you’re going for and you have a little length on top to work with, you can totally pull off an undercut. An undercut is a haircut in which the sides of the head are shaved very short, usually a zero or a one length on clippers, and the top of the head has longer hair, usually anywhere from three inches in length or longer.</p>
