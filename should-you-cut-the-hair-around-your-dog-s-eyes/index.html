How Can I Hold My Dog Still So I Can Trim Hair Around Her From cuteness.com</p>
<p>Depending on how much facial hair a whoodle inherits from its wheaten terrier parent, you might need to trim the hair around the dog�s eyes with scissors occasionally to keep it from irritating the eyes. This is a very delicate part of the cut, as you need to be very careful not to poke your dog with the scissors. With a small comb, pull the hair up and away from your dog�s eyes. You can either flush the wound (being careful to avoid the eye) or wipe the cut with a moistened gauze pad.</p>
<h3 id="dogs-can-see-much-better-when-fur-is-not-covering-their-eyes-which-you-can-imagine-allows-them-to-navigate-the-world-without-confusion-and-collisions">Dogs can see much better when fur is not covering their eyes, which, you can imagine, allows them to navigate the world without confusion (and collisions).</h3><p>Save yourself some trouble (and foul smells) by regularly grooming your dog�s butt. Secure it with a small rubber band or a doggy hair tie, or, if your pooch is especially fashionable, a tiny bow. Apply some ear powder on your fingers and firmly grip a small amount of hair surrounding the opening of your dog�s ear canal. Cleanse the wound with warm water or saline solution. Concentrate on the hair that is on the top of the nose and stop at the eyes; This is a very delicate part of the cut, as you need to be very careful not to poke your dog with the scissors.</p>
