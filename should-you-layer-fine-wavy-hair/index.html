<p>I agree, layers would probably work best. As a general rule, the shorter the layers, the more volume. Layered bobs are also one of the best hairstyles for fine hair and they are currently the other big trend in hair design. If it’s fine and thin, light layers might be preferred, to keep as much hair as possible.</p>
<h3 id="also-keep-the-hair-cut-slightly-below-the-shoulders">Also keep the hair cut slightly below the shoulders.</h3><p>You can get away with layers easier with shoulder length strands than mile long locks. You can grow your hair into long waist length curls without the traingle effect if you have thin hair. If you have fine, wavy hair… fine, wavy hair usually doesn’t have enough thickness in the fiber to really hold its natural waves, so shorter lengths and. Truly thin hair can look even thinner with layers. So if you are blessed with thicker but fine hair in abundance go for it. Bold layers are always a fun way to play up your wavy hairstyle.</p>
