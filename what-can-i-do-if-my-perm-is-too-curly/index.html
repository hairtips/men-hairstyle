<p>For this purpose, wash your hair with moisturizing shampoo within the first 3 days of getting the treatment. I recommend that you speak with your stylist (or a new stylist if you feel the current one is insufficiently capable) about having a corrective perm service using a gentle perm formula to soften the curls by rolling the hair on larger rods and processing the new perm. You can always undergo a corrective perm if your hair is in sufficient condition to withstand the process. I recommend that you speak with your stylist (or a new stylist if you feel the current one is insufficiently capable) about having a corrective perm service using a gentle perm formula to soften the curls by rolling the hair on larger rods and processing the new perm.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-i-do-to-relax-it-a-little">What can i do to relax it a little?</h3><p>Give hair a deep conditioning treatment. If your curls need a little extra moisture, treat them every other week with our deep treatment to rebuild chemically processed curls and maintain hair’s health with a combination of essential amino acids, proteins and effective moisturizers. Do not wash too much. The goal is to add as much weight to the curls as you can to help stretch them out and loosen the tightness of the curl. In the future your hair stylist can create looser curls by taking bigger sections on large rods, but the time of the processing solution. If your perm is still too curly, ask you stylist about a curl reducing service.</p>

<p>As with any curls, it’s important to maintain your new look to avoid frizz and tangles. Allow the mixture to remain for 10 to 20 minutes before rinsing it out with lukewarm water. Your newly curled hair needs at least 24 hours to set correctly, so if you wish to undo your perm, simply hop into the shower and shampoo.</p>
