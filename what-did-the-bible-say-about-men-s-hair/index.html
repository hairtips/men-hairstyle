<p>I don’t think men’s hair would have fallen had adam not sinned. History shows that short hair on men has been around for a long time—much longer than many realize. A man�s hair should look masculine. He says, “if you say they are both based on god’s created design, then you have to say long hair is wrong for men in every culture.” in other words, if they have the same meaning, and they refer to god’s created design, then you have to say that long hair on men and short hair on women are always wrong in every culture without exception.</p>
<h3 id="leviticus-1927-prohibits-people-from-039rounding-off-the-sides039-of-their-head-and-many-commentators-take-that-to-mean-that-people-should-let-the-hair-on-their-temples-grow-indefinitely">Leviticus 19:27 prohibits people from �rounding off the sides� of their head, and many commentators take that to mean that people should let the hair on their temples grow indefinitely.</h3><p>They say that whoever is born with braided or knotted hair has divine/ supernatural powers and must be revered and in fact they are not humans but supernatural brings who look humans, but interestingly the real humans ( man or woman) who choose to braid their hair ( including knotted hair, corn rows style, dreadlocks style, multiple braids, etc…) are considered to have evil spirits. Because paul mentions long hair, some have been afraid to cut or style their hair at all. If they don’t cut it, of course it will grow long. He fought god’s battles, was a leader of men, and penned most of the psalms. It is easy for us today to assume the length and cut of a jewish. Every church must implement this distinction.</p>

<p>Does the bible say this? Secondly male pattern baldness was not god’s design. Any length is appropriate if the hair is long enough to be a covering. Women wore hair down to the waist. History shows that short hair on men has been around for a long time—much longer than many realize.</p>
