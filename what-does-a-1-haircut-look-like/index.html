<p>That isn�t what most people nowadays (including many skinheads) think of as a ‘skinhead look’, though. By cutting all the hair to a stationary guide, you can achieve a strong, dramatic and defined outline edge which can make fine hair look much fuller. Well, the traditional skinhead look is a #3 or #2 crop. I think that tapered haircuts are stylish and look good on just about everyone.</p>

<p>You could call it a very short induction buzz cut if the entire scalp is trimmed down to the same, even length.

<p>Since the clipper guards’ sizes are related to different hair lengths, guys looking for the perfect haircut need to know about every number when asking for specific styles.

<p>That isn�t what most people nowadays (including many skinheads) think of as a ‘skinhead look’, though. I have dark, nearly black hair.
