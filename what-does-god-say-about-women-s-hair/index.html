<p>It’s not that braided hair is sinful, but it is more worthwhile to develop godly character than to coiffure the hair. The bible also in verse 16 of the scripture stated clearly that the long hair of a woman is her glory and for the covering of her head. There is a contrast set up here between outward, fleeting beauty and inward, lasting beauty. And, as a friendly reminder, jonathan edwards had long hair!” well, we will get to jonathan edwards in a minute.</p>
<h3 id="but-if-you-say-that-they-are-both-based-on-gods-created-design-then-you-have-to-say-that-long-hair-on-men-and-short-hair-on-women-are-always-wrong-in-every-culture-without-exception">But if you say that they are both based on god’s created design, then you have to say that long hair on men and short hair on women are always wrong in every culture without exception.</h3><p>God is far more concerned with an attitude of submission than an outward display of submission via a head covering. However, he was not adverse to making changes to reach different people groups: They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but they are to keep the hair of their heads trimmed. God sees the heart, and a beautiful woman has a “gentle and quiet spirit,” whether or not her hair is plaited into fancy braids. There is a chain of authority in creation. It’s not that braided hair is sinful, but it is more worthwhile to develop godly character than to coiffure the hair.</p>
