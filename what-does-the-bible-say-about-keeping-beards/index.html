<p>What does the bible say about keeping christmas? In the book of leviticus 19:27, the bible instructs the people of israel on how they ought to carry themselves. At the heart of it, always striving to be clean can come at the cost of relationship with others. Acts of protecting others are a very core principle of the bible.</p>
<h3 id="the-old-testament-law-forbade-priests-from-shaving-their-heads-or-beards--leviticus-215-">The old testament law forbade priests from shaving their heads or beards ( leviticus 21:5 ).</h3><p>For whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.” although christ used this while teaching about swearing, it also applies to our relationship with others. Under the law of moses, there were rules ( leviticus 19:27) about not trimming the corners of your beard (i.e., goatees were banned). Conscience is the knowledge of right and wrong, and a feeling that one should do what is right. “growing a beard is not mandatory in islam” is not actually one hundred % right statement. And if you’re brave enough to face the facts, then here they are! The bible teaches, indirectly, that keeping secrets can be either good or bad, but it does not clearly delineate the right and wrong uses of secrets.</p>
