This allows moisture to penetrate easily, and.</p>

<p>The reason asian hair tends to be thicker is that it has around 10 layers of cuticles. Additionally, hemp seed oil softens hair, enhances hair, and promotes elasticity. On the flip side, when your hair’s porosity is low, it’s super closed up and repels against water. Take a glass of water and a thread from your brush. Asian hair tend.</p>

<p>In fact you likely need products that add protein to your hair because the cuticles are far more open. The hairs with high porosity are usually curly, charged and bloated, because their cuticle layer is strongly opened. But people with low blood pressure should avoid this.
