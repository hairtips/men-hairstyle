This allows moisture to penetrate easily, and.</p>

<p>The reason asian hair tends to be thicker is that it has around 10 layers of cuticles. Additionally, hemp seed oil softens hair, enhances hair, and promotes elasticity. On the flip side, when your hairâs porosity is low, itâs super closed up and repels against water. Take a glass of water and a thread from your brush. Asian hair tend.</p>
