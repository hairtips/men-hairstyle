<p>No, it is not haram. In 24:31 god is asking the women to use their cover (khimar)( being a dress, a coat, a shawl, a shirt, a blouse, a tie, a scarf.

<p>And that they utter what they do not practice? in pondering this passage of the qur�an, we have to remember that both madness and seduction are religious and cultural categories. If god so willed to order the women to cover their heads or their hair, nothing would have prevented him from doing so. He guides and directs us to achieve.</p>
