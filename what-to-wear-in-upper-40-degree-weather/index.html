10 40DegreeWeather Outfits That Are Cute and Warm Who From whowhatwear.co.uk</p>
<p>When temperatures are in the upper 50s, you really don�t need any base layers. You want to consider the weather when buying cycling shorts.

<h3 id="chilly-but-moderate-weather-dominate-portlands-winter-with-temperatures-often-in-the-40s-and-low-50s-and-some-days-into-the-30s">Chilly but moderate weather dominate portland’s winter with temperatures often in the 40’s and low 50’s, and some days into the 30’s.</h3><p>So in order to avoid freezing in the first place, carefully planning what to wear in cold weather is absolutely essential in my travels. My hands, feet, nose and stomach get cold first and once i am cold it takes a lot of effort to get warm again (think hot water bottles, wooly blankets and cups of tea).

For everyday wear, jeans, a nice shirt and cardigan should be enough to keep you warm while still looking good for photo ops. They can keep you really warm in the 60 degree weather.</p>
