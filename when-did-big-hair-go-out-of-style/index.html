<p>They get noticed, set a trend, &amp; a bunch more people follow their move. It certainly doesn�t seem to have much to do with whether the style is actually flattering on a given body. Sideburns dwindled in the 19th century, and mustaches came in vogue around the 1870s. Not 100% sure how true this is, but beards falling out of.</p>

<p>At first the removal of hair from the vagina was a symbol of class and culture and its practice became a social norm as lower classes imitated those they admired.

<p>Trends are largely driven by celebrities, and butts were well talked about and. But i�m not saying that�s why they went out of style. If you�re only going to ditch one out of style clothing trend, make it this. The french braid is probably always going to be in style.

<p>Hard rock bands like slade and aerosmith helped shape their musical sound. Their societies started accepting anything goes behaviors, they turned soft, and down the drain they all flowed. Sideburns dwindled in the 19th century, and mustaches came in vogue around the 1870s. Presidents of the late 19th and early 20th century. Soon everyone‘s clean shaven, so some other folks.</p>
