Where to Buy 1930s dresses, clothing and patterns From vintagedancer.com</p>
<p>I think zara is good for accessories but i�ve given up buying skirts and dresses from there as they�re always too short. No writing on the shirts, just the shirts you can buy in. I handpick 1930s style dresses from many popular vintage style clothing retailers like modcloth, uniquevintage, forever 21, and nordstrom that surprisingly carry many wonderful and affordable 1930s inspired dresses. Those holey undergarments in your closet belong to the trash.</p>
<h3 id="come-up-with-a-core-selection-of-shops-that-stock-staples-that-fit-without-the-need-for-altering-them">Come up with a core selection of shops that stock staples that fit without the need for altering them.</h3><p>How to dress in your thirties: Brands that i will buy from there are halogen (mostly sweaters), pleione (for indestructible work tops), foxcroft (for button up shirts), equipment (for silk shirts). Custom made garments fit better than anything you’ll find off the rail and will last for a lifetime. When you reach your 30s, it’s more important than ever to build a reliable capsule wardrobe that consists of timeless, classic staples that you can easily wear for both work or play. It�s pretty much the same as turning 29. But in your thirties, you can.</p>
