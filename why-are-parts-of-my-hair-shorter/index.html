<p>I have a sorta faux hawk thing going. The best part about short, wavy hair, adds stevens, is that it�s incredibly low maintenance. The hairs of the eyebrow are also coarser than head hair and have a curved shape, even if the head hair is straight. If you flat iron or hot curl your hair too frequently, this may explain why your ends pop every time you comb them.</p>
<h3 id="age-affects-hair-growth-because-your-hairs-growth-cycle-becomes-shorter-as-you-get-older">Age affects hair growth because your hair’s growth cycle becomes shorter as you get older.</h3><p>It�s because the bottom edge of your scalp in the back is the lowest point on your head, so even if all the hair grows at the same speed, it�s going to be the furthest down and therefore look the longest. Whenever i got my hair cut shorter than about collar bone length, it would get poofy. It�s because the bottom edge of your scalp in the back is the lowest point on your head, so even if all the hair grows at the same speed, it�s going to be the furthest down and therefore look the longest. Hair grows at the same rate, but not in the same area and at the same time. The answer involves your cyclic hair growth patterns, hair density, genetics, hormones, and nutrition. Differentiate the straight parts against the curly by making sure your hair is cut dry, especially since curls differ from person to person.</p>

<p>Hair grows at the same rate, but not in the same area and at the same time. Long hair tends to make a woman look younger and somewhat immature.

<p>This can be due to too much heat styling. As for why hair on our head continually grows longer, this is actually not true.
