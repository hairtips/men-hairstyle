Undercutting in welding may occur as a result of high travel speed, poor welding techniques, excessive heat, and too high amperage.</p>

Half of your salary goes in getting a trim after every 2 weeks; Because they somehow believe that they’ll sell faster, despite it not really being the case unless they undercut so badly that someone will buy and relist it for a quick profit. I set my min posting to 30%marketavg, which may or may not be the correct amount, ignoring items below min. The result of which is a weak weld that is prone to cracking along the toes. Simply so which is better fade or undercut?</p>
