<p>I shave my armpits and i am far from gay and far from being any kind of swimmer i just wanna look clean and i hate having hair there. Just out of interest, and after a rather hilarious debate about the state of our own body hair on our morning zoom call, glamour asked the men in our lives for their opinion.

Others might find that shaving their armpits helps them be more comfortable in their own skin and avoid the discomfort of having hairy pits.</p>
