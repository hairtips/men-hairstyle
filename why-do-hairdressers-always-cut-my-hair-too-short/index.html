<p>I don�t think this was a good strategy for my hair type. The recordkeeping issue comes into play in this because a few notes in client�s record can help the stylist know what the client wants from session to session.

<p>I love my long hair (short hair makes me look pudgier imo/just doesn�t suit me) and i like to keep it that way. Second, switch up how you style your hair so that you give yourself a new. Your paying for the service and should get what you ask for! In my experience, always do. You have a lot of.</p>

<p>I don�t think this was a good strategy for my hair type. If you want a carbon copy of a cut and style you loved, take a picture and show me. If they would part from ear to ear instead of the base of the hairline, i�m sure so much wouldn�t be trimmed off. But i don�t fool with them.</p>
