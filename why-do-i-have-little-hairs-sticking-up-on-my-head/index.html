<p>Despite their name, baby hairs often stay with you past adolescence and late into adulthood. Breakage is most often seen in. When you�re styling your hair, you might sometimes notice fine little hairs sticking up around your hairline. My guess is that a hair follicle goes a little haywire and over produces or maybe gets clogged or infected so it grows faster than it should and wider than it should.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-thought-is-to-ask-you-specifically-if-this-unusual-hair-growth-is-only-occurring-on-your-head">My first thought is to ask you specifically if this unusual hair growth is only occurring on your head.</h3><p>It helps to protect hair from heat and it helps to hold the style. They tend to be reluctant to settle down, and if you don’t do it correctly your efforts might break down. If bacteria, a virus, or fungus gets into a hair follicle, you can get this kind of infection. If they were new growth, wouldn�t they eventually grow out and lay down? Pomade will look like you have a plastic helmet on. They could also be the result of breakage caused by styling damage.</p>

<p>I�ve had it since i was born and consider it a birthmark. Pretty quickly, you should notice that it�s giving your hair some bulk and volume, as well as the beginnings of that fuzzy halo.
