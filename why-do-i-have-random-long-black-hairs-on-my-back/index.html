<h3 id="back-hair-poses-no-medical-risks-but-you-may-choose-to-have-it-removed-for-aesthetic-reasons">Back hair poses no medical risks, but you may choose to have it removed for aesthetic reasons.</h3><p>I always have an urge to pull them out, but i try. Think it weakens the follicle and the regrowth sometimes is. And it�s only two hairs, at approximately identical locations on both sides. However i beg you to not pull them out, this can develop into a condition i have called trichotillamania, fortunately mine isn�t obvious however if you google you�ll find people with huge bald patches, if you�re interest youtube �girls on the pull�. As a result, this lone follicle has more time to grow a longer hair. Every cell in your body has a set of instructions that tells your cells how to behave, including how long your hair should grow before replacing it with a new hair.</p>

<p>Megacolon may develop when feces are impacted in colon and colon no longer pushes contents along. You should think of them as part of the normal random variation that is present at all levels of our biology, without which evolution would be impossible.
