<p>It just looks really set and cool. (brager did a similar look on olivia holt.) Curly hair is a bit more delicate than straight hair, and the tighter the curl or coil, the more fragile the strand. But thick hair looks better when it�s long (less triangular) so i�m leaving the overall length as it is. Sure your friends may.</p>

<p>So, i think for my next haircut i�m going to get some shorter layers so that the top of my head is more volumized and i get that half up/half down effect. There will be no hassle to brush your curly hair at any time; Curly hair also resists looking greasy, meaning that you do not have to shampoo as.</p>

<p>Instead, your hairdo regularly draws attention. Curly hair is bouncy and it looks charming. It always looks like you put in effort. Sure your friends may say you look better with straight hair not saying you don�t, but you could make it work for you if you. It makes you unique, confident and relaxed.</p>

<p>Curly hair always looks like it requires a lot. But thick hair looks better when it�s long (less triangular) so i�m leaving the overall length as it is. The twists and bends of curly hair prevent sebum in scalp from reaching the ends. It makes you unique, confident and relaxed. Yes, she looks good with straight hair but there’s a.</p>

<p>Yes, she looks good with straight hair but there’s a level of superficiality to that style that doesn’t exist in the photo of her with curly hair. I started crying at my pitiful little nub. I think people look better with their natural hair color. If you wait too long, you may rough up the hair cuticle, causing your curls.</p>

<p>It always looks like you put in effort. A bit of oil does hair good. Hair types go from 1a to 4c, 1a being thin and straight hair (think cameron diaz) and 4c being naturally coiled, extremely tight curly hair (think solange knowles). Your hair may sometimes feel like straw It just looks really set and cool. (brager did a.</p>

<p>Curls generally need a little extra love, and it�s. But thankfully i�ve grown out of it and am now more comfortable with my curls! I think people look better with their natural hair color. This affects your hair less than the shape of the follicle, however. Come rain, wind, or snow, your curls will stay curled.</p>

<p>But thankfully i�ve grown out of it and am now more comfortable with my curls! I stay away from color because of the harsh chemicals. It just made me wish i had straight hair and resented my curls. Curly hair is bouncy and it looks charming. Many closet curlies are married to a flat iron because they think men prefer.</p>
