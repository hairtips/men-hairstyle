<p>I used to be the same, never wore my hair up, now i can chop and change throughout the day. How you look really does come down to who your parents are. When you go out or party, all eyes are on you. For girls, our hair is a mess most of the time when we wake up, we�re not all primped and made up.</p>
<h3 id="we-all-love-people-with-a-perfect-personality">We all love people with a perfect personality.</h3><p>But acceptance means being at peace with the way you look. This isn’t the first time i’ve had a pixie cut, and having long hair in between kind of confirmed that for me. “why did you cut your hair short?” the indian girl jumped down my throat before the latin girl had a chance to respond, though once i settled her down, i managed to get my answer. Many people are attracted to you in a different way and look. In any case you shouldn’t focus on things you can’t change as it’s not healthy or helpful. 2) why you need to accept how you look this is not just understanding why you’re ugly.</p>

<p>This will open your pores and prepare your skin for a deep cleanse. You might be questioning how you would look with short hair, if you can pull off daring pixies or shags, or if you’d even know how to style a bob. It�s every girl�s worst nightmare.

<p>After a while, you�ll probably be used to it, and won�t see the perceived flaws you think you see. Therefore, having the hair up looks good on them because it puts the focus back on their face. It�s every girl�s worst nightmare. I tend to prefer little to no makeup on women. (real hair is not all one.</p>

<p>But don’t take advantage of your beauty to manipulate others. You do not need another person to validate your looks. If you feel ugly then no doubt you are probably focussing on a few key areas of you appearance that you aren’t happy with and that you think are ‘ugly’. In general, i prefer having my hair short. Sometimes it.</p>
