</center> <p><strong>Why Does Hair Only Grow On Certain Parts Of The Body</strong>, Body hairs—like those on the chest, eyebrows, face, and other extremities—do not grow as long as the hairs on the head, obviously. Levels of this hormone are significantly higher in men, which is why they generally have thicker body hair and why they have hair on more areas of their body.</p>

<p>Vellus hair is replaced with thicker hair in certain areas of your body during puberty. As the cells form, they push older cells out of the follicle. That’s because the longest hairs fall out, having been pushed out of their sockets by newer hairs working up from below. Alopecia areata is often associated with complete hair loss on the entire body, but in fact, it can occur in small spots 1.</p>
<h3 id="the-condition-is-an-abnormal-amount-of-male-hormones">The condition is an abnormal amount of male hormones.</h3><p>This is also true for the hair on the head. There are different types of hair on our bodies that only grows to a certain length (ie arm hair, eyebrows). You may notice your hair stops growing in one spot or seems to be growing slowly on one. During the growth phase, the hair follicle embeds in the skin (dermal), receiving nutrients from the bloodstream and allowing the cells lining the follicle to divide and create the protein chain that your hair is made of. Inside the follicle, new hair cells form at the root of the hair shaft. Alopecia areata is often associated with complete hair loss on the entire body, but in fact, it can occur in small spots 1.</p>

<p>One popular theory is that the hair helps keep your smell around, which, in turn, attracts potential partners.

This is essentially poor circulation that is due to narrowing of the core arteries that transport blood to the feet and the legs, along with the formation of plaque. Body hairs—like those on the chest, eyebrows, face,.</p>
