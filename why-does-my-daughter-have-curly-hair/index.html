<h3 id="suyuan-takes-her-daughter-to-a-beauty-training-school-to-get-her-hair-curled-but-the-result-is-a-mess">Suyuan takes her daughter to a beauty training school to get her hair curled, but the result is a mess.</h3><p>It is really curly when it gets wet but it dries with a only a slight wave on the top of her head and straight on the sides and back where it isn�t as long. But why does hair become curly with age for some people? My dad is a red head (and do am i) and you can imagine his curls, but my mom has pencil straight hair. I’m soo upset cause it makes it harder for me to style my hair and wanting to have that very sleek look. When you have a flatter follicle, the hair will be curlier. I am not sure what to do with her hair.</p>
