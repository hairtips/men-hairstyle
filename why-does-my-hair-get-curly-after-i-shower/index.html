<p>Something that clumps hair together. Since curls need more moisture than other hair types, don�t shampoo more than three times a week. I suppose your hair is drying straighter with the cap on and it doesn�t allow much room for your hair to frizz either. Not only does it dry out your hair, but it can also cause your hair.</p>

<p>Olive oil helps to soften puff and split ends, which will leave your hair shiny and smooth while avocado has biotin, a vitamin that will make your hair stronger. I was wondering what it meant when i got my hair cut (i got curtain bangs and layers) they started to get wavy/curly but the rest of my hair was straight/frizzy..</p>

<p>The fibers on towels act like little fingers that tangle hair as you scrub it dry with a towel. After a shower, dry hair can be due to your scalp not producing enough oil to moisturize your hair or due to your scalp and hair not holding onto moisture. When straight hair becomes curly this suggests that something is happening.</p>

<p>This is why a wavy hair needs a gel or mousse to hold the texture when the hair dries (a slightly different principle to when your hair is straight and curled in the shower). Why does my hair get matted all the time? If the water you shower with is “hard water”, that is water containing mineral deposits, it can.</p>

<p>Hair clumps best when it is soaking wet, so once you are out of the shower, getting wavy hair to clump becomes more difficult. When i get out of the shower i try to apply my products as soon as possible, i even put off getting dressed, but by the time i get to the mirror my hair is no.</p>

<p>When it rains/if you sweat, the moisture resets your hair and because you haven�t brushed it, it curls a lot more because you haven�t messed with it so i just does its own thing. However, after the shower is not the time to do it. Your leg hair can look more curly when you first step out of the shower.</p>

<p>“the more moisturized your hair is, the happier your curls will be,” alvarez says. I suppose your hair is drying straighter with the cap on and it doesn�t allow much room for your hair to frizz either. This is normally because the water makes your hair heavy and stretched, so it dries straight. Hair texture, frequency of brushing, exposure to.</p>

<p>This answer is most likely. One reason has to do with the quality of the water we use when washing our hair. Frizzy hair and natural curls go. If it helps, i have type 3c thick hair. I discovered the curly girl method for my hair and thought about how my hair has been over the years and decided to.</p>
