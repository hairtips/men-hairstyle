<p>By tying hair up in a tight ponytail, you are actually lifting the tissue above and below your ear, creating a lift. So i made a ponytail at the nape of my neck and cut around 4 inches off using the same method and it looked excellent!

<p>For example, throwing your hair back in a ponytail might be a quick way to cool off and get your hair off your neck, but experts warn that. I very rarely use a ponytail or bun, mainly because of how thick and heavy my hair is. Tie it back with a hair tie where you want your ponytail to sit..</p>

Wearing your hair in the same style, like a high ponytail, cornrows, buns, or braids for days at a time, can also contribute to more pain. They are a great no slip band that keeps hair off of my face while.</p>
