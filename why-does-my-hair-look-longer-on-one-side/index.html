<p>It’s common for brushed out waves or curls to look straighter on top, but to poof or wave/curl at the ends still. Or why one side of your hair is thicker than the other? This means that there are more hairs per square inch of scalp on the “thicker” side, and fewer on the side that “lays flatter”. When performing.</p>
