<p>Why hairdressers never do what you want it’s a common complaint among women and men. But if you really want long hair, we suggest your get hair extensions instead. Your long hair is killing your career. The finer and lower in density your hair is, the shorter it�s maximum length will likely be before it looks trashed.</p>
<h3 id="everybody039s-hair-appears-longer-when-wet-just-because-of-the-weight-of-the-water-on-the-hair">Everybody�s hair appears longer when wet just because of the weight of the water on the hair.</h3><p>The head of hair in my left avatar photo no longer exists. I plan to have cut and start over i have been transitioning to natural for 9 months now, and noticed i have shorter hair in those areas i’ve mentioned, please if anyone could help me grow. I looked down at my hair, broken, processed, and dry, and i couldn�t believe how much shorter it was than just a year ago—especially since i hadn�t actually cut it since. The soft curls i had before are gone. Short hair is much lighter than long hair, and so if you have curly or wavy hair, they will be curly with a lighter weight than short hair. Curly hair can end up looking about the same or even longer than it does down, because curls normally make hair appear shorter (due to the sproing effect), but when curly hair is braided, it stretches out the curls so the braid shows more of the actual length.</p>
