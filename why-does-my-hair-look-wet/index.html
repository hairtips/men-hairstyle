<p>Fellow asian here, for a damper look i suggest pomade over gel as most gels tend to harden up and you lose the �flowiness� of your hair. Often wavy hair needs support from gel or mousse to maintain its texture as it dries. Take some pictures of your hair in direct sunlight and you might be surprised. Some naturals can�t.</p>

<p>Wet frizz can also occur while you are applying your styling products and/or when air drying. Without the usual volume, you can get a good idea of how far your hair loss has really gone. This provides the scalp with more coverage. You can have stringy hair that is not limp,. This is why a wavy hair needs a gel.</p>

<p>Stringy hair is often more limp and less bouncy than usual. As the water evaporates, it draws some of the natural oils out of your scalp, causing your hair to curl at the end especially if the air is dry. Then when it dries it�s like the whole thing expands, and the hairs repel each other, so it doesn�t stick.</p>

<p>Everybody�s hair appears longer when wet just because of the weight of the water on the hair. My pet theory is that it stays wet for longer (something that happens if i sleep on it damp, too), meaning the scalp gets irritated and overproduces oil. Pomade also works on curly hair because it flattens the curls out as you comb.</p>

<p>Everybody�s hair appears longer when wet just because of the weight of the water on the hair. When wet, your hair becomes heavy and/or stretched. When your hair gets wet, the water molecules are attracted to the oppositely charged ions on your hair strands. The fur of the other hamster started to look wet too. There is no grease in.</p>

<p>If i don�t wet the roots it doesn�t even look wet! I was at a loss of what to do. Hi my hamster is 9 months old and for a few days now his fur all over looks wet and all standing up, but it feels dry. This is normally because the water makes your hair heavy and stretched, so.</p>

<p>Both men and women are after getting a wet hair look without damaging their hair too much. Wet frizz typically occurs after washing your hair, and can happen after rinsing out your conditioner and wringing out excess water. You also see your hair thinner when you use gel, wax or other hair products which help stick hair together. My pet.</p>
