My stylist cuts my hair wet (big sigh), so the left side of my hair (3a) is usually longer than my right; The experiment involved cutting the hair and then measuring its.

<p>The difference is noticeable even when my hair is. Also have some layers and got it thinned. My dad is a red head (and do am i) and you can imagine his curls, but my mom has pencil straight hair. Tiktok video from hayl (@hailzu_): My hair only curls on one side of my head??</p>

<p>Yet, the (entire) right side of my hair on my head is as straight as a board. The difference is noticeable even when my hair is. You are turning your curling iron heat up too high.

<p>Which side of sponge brush to use on short hair? I cannot express how much rage this sound encites in me. Its to do with what side the crown is on.

<p>It’s common for brushed out waves or curls to look straighter on top, but to poof or wave/curl at the ends still. This sounds weird, but maybe try pulling a different direction while drying/straightening? This is one of my most frequently asked questions and i see curly girls asking this question online a lot too. Because the hair sponge is.</p>
