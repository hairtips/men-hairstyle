Itï¿½s extremely annoying, but mostly abnormally weird.</p>

<p>The difference is noticeable even when my hair is. Also have some layers and got it thinned. My dad is a red head (and do am i) and you can imagine his curls, but my mom has pencil straight hair. Tiktok video from hayl (@hailzu_): My hair only curls on one side of my head??</p>

<p>Yet, the (entire) right side of my hair on my head is as straight as a board. The difference is noticeable even when my hair is. You are turning your curling iron heat up too high.

<p>Which side of sponge brush to use on short hair? I cannot express how much rage this sound encites in me. Its to do with what side the crown is on.

<p>Itâs common for brushed out waves or curls to look straighter on top, but to poof or wave/curl at the ends still. This sounds weird, but maybe try pulling a different direction while drying/straightening? This is one of my most frequently asked questions and i see curly girls asking this question online a lot too. Because the hair sponge is.</p>

<p>Iï¿½ve gotten most of my hair to grow, but there is this little section on both sides of my hair that, when combed, is a giant poof! The curls on one side of my head never seem to match the curls on the other. When you use an extreme amount of heat (e.g. It almost makes me not want to.</p>
