<p>Why does my dog eat sticks? Posted by 7 years ago. Cutting it longer than everything else will give it the weight it needs to lay down. I used to use gel and stuff, but i really don�t like that because it either makes my hair all hard, or sticky. The stick has two rotating switches that contain circular resistant.</p>

<p>Small quantities of oil can help your hair to fill up. As a final step, use hot air to heat up your side hairs (as close to the root as possible without burning your skin).
