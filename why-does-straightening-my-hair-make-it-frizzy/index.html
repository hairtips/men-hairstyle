<p>Damaged waves and curls do not clump as easily and therefore, they will try to push away from other strands causing frizz. I’ve also tried straightening my hair first and curling it afterwards but it still becomes frizzy after it’s been curled. My hair was a lot better and less frizzy. The best solution to solve this problem is to.</p>

<p>And this can happen for two reasons. Ceramic, tourmaline and titanium irons are usually the best option, because these metals conduct heat more evenly so they are less likely to dry out your hair and cause frizz. This is why it’s so important to work in small sections as you’ll be less likely to miss anything and your hair will.</p>

<p>You can also spray a shine or straightening serum on a flat paddle brush and run the brush over frizzy hairs to smooth them down. An iron at the proper temperature will dry the tissue where the plates pressed it. It looks frizzy and kinda puffed up after curling. This is a major cause of frizzy hair. This leftover moisture.</p>

<p>The material that your flat iron is made of can play a role in whether you wind up with frizzy hair or not. When the tissue test comes out clean, you are ready to use the iron. Namely, because shampoos alone can make your hair poofy or rough, and it cannot keep your hair sleek and straight for long periods.</p>

<p>As matrix lead educator roch lemay told allure, running the iron over damp hair creates steam and causes bubbles to form within the hair fibre, which cracks along the hair shaft. once the crack reaches the strand�s cuticle (which is the outermost part of your hair, and acts as a protectant ), you�ll start seeing damage in the form of.</p>

<p>My hair was a lot better and less frizzy. This is why it’s so important to work in small sections as you’ll be less likely to miss anything and your hair will be completely dry.
