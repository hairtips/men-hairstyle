<p>For yves, the problem is largely attributed to hair tight curl pattern. There are various ways to straighten hair, though they are primarily irons and chemicals.

It stayed like that for years (even during my two pregnancies with obviously, hormonal changes). Due to this i will shave the lower part a bit in the. Use.</p>

<p>A cut that�s done carefully can even force my hair to largely curl under even tho my 1c wave pattern wants to head out.

<p>I had the same problem because i would always brush the front of my hair back so that i could wear my hair in a ponytail/bun, but after a while my curls around my edges didn�t come back and it was just frizzy.bi switched back in forth between protein treatments and deep conditioners, and avoided putting my hair in. In.</p>

<p>This way of styling would not cause the flip at your current length. My hair went from having a few curls to being a wavy mess. At age 24 (no hormonal changes, pregnancy, stress, nothing), i got a haircut and my hair curled up to around a 3a curl. Alternatively, if you went with your natural curls, you could pump.</p>
