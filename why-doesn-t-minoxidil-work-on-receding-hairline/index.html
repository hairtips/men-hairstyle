<p>The hair follicles in your hairline aren’t significantly different from the others. The drug is approved by the fda for this purpose, but not for treating the frontal hair loss that results in a receding hairline. Minoxidil is a common hair loss treatment. Minoxidil works by improving blood flow to the area in which it’s applied.</p>
<h3 id="all-hair-loss-medications-have-the-potential-to-regrow-all-your-scalp-hair-but-different-locations-on-your-scalp-have-different-sensitivities-to-tdht-so-they-don039t-respond-equally-to-your-meds">All hair loss medications have the potential to regrow all your scalp hair, but different locations on your scalp have different sensitivities to t/dht, so they don�t respond equally to your meds.</h3><p>Interestingly, minoxidil has been approved by the fda as a treatment for hair loss on the top of the scalp only. However, a study on rogaine conducted in 2003 and published in the dermatology times found that the topical solution also was effective in treating frontal hair loss. In men, receding hairline starts from the side of their temples. For women, a receding hairline may be due to frontal fibrosing alopecia, or scarring of the scalp. So we can say that minoxidil actively causes hairs of telogen (resting phase) to fall out, then it drives hair follicles go into growing phase (anagen). It shouldn�t be applied on hairline and crown area because it will only shed your healthy hairs and will grow tiny ones which eventually will fall too.</p>

<p>What it can do is increase density in the areas behind the hairline that are in the process of thinning. As such, there’s no reason minoxidil shouldn’t work for a receding hairline. Because of this, there isn’t a lot of research that compares their effectiveness as treatments for a receding hairline. As it stands, there hasn’t been enough research into.</p>

<p>As it stands, there hasn’t been enough research into the efficacy of minoxidil when it comes to a receding hairline. This often begins more toward the sides of the head with the center holding out the longest. In men, receding hairline starts from the side of their temples. Whether or not minoxidil will have any effect will largely be based.</p>

<p>It is not recommended for women whose hair loss occurs suddenly or who experience patchy or uneven hair loss. Crown balding is slower and from the time it is first recognized, it often early in the thinning process.

<p>Apply it to your scalp and it can potentially improve hair density and increase the rate of growth. It also doesn’t work for a completely bald scalp. Minoxidil is a common hair loss treatment. That is why many people have turned to rogaine for receding hairlines. Pretty stoked cause i’m in my mid 20s and a bald head just doesn’t.</p>

<p>Minoxidil does not regrow hairs that are lost from roots. There is a belief that minoxidil will not work on the front of the scalp on receding hairlines.

<p>Rogaine isn’t meant for a receding hairline or baldness at the front of your scalp. Rogaine is an fda approved topical hair loss treatment, also known as minoxidil.

<p>This drug was initially invented to be an oral. When you stop using the product it will bring back hair loss. But why doesn’t it work on receding hairline?
