</center> <p><strong>Why Is Dying Hair Black Haram</strong>, If a black employee is prohibited from dying their hair blonde because it’s not a naturally occurring hair color, as was seen in the hooters case, then employers must be. There is no explicit reasoning given by the prophet (peace be upon him) of why it is haram to dye your hair black.</p>

<p>A few months ago a friend posted on one of our wattsapp groups that plucking eyebrows was haram, it was a picture and in the picture there was a tweezer. Dyeing the hair with henna is a confirmed sunnah most of the scholars in india use red color henna mahandi for their beard i asked most of them but they said it is allowed in islam but some says it is sunnah but as for my information the tree which these leaves come it will not growth in desert area but all arab is have full desert from where these leave come to our prophet they. This indicates that it is haraam to change the hair colour to black. While i can understand why a majority of �ulama (islamic scholars) considered black hair dye to be haram, it still seems overly simplistic to take that position.</p>
<h3 id="as-people-look-around-the-different-cities-of-our-fair-country-one-might-notice-that-many-people-nowadays-are-coloring-their-hair-to-cover-grey-or-just-for-the-fun-of-it">As people look around the different cities of our fair country, one might notice that many people nowadays are coloring their hair to cover grey or just for the fun of it.</h3><p>As i didn’t know plucking eyebrows was haraam i straightaway thought, well i have it threaded it’s ok little did i. According to the understanding of the quran and the authentic sunnah it is clear that you can colour you hair black by mixing some other colour to it. So if you have sensitive skin, black hair dye may be even more risky for you than a lighter color like blonde. The hadith explained that people who color their hair with black will not enter the heaven. This is deception, other related issues are wearing a wig,or lengthening your hairs with false hair, this is prohibited too. Yes, the dying of your hair black is haraam.</p>
