<p>Hair may be worn too tightly and this may apply undue pressure to certain sections of the scalp, but not the other, which may impact the rate of hair growth to different sections. Especially if you massage your scalp with some warmed up jamaican black. Everyday life exposes our hair to stressors that can cause breakage and thinning. In order.</p>

<p>Hair loss can be caused by a number of factors, which include genetics, diet, medication, overuse of perms or straightening and your body’s natural cycle. I swear my roots/kitchen are 4c but whenever my new growth comes in it falls/looks like 4b. It’s completely normal to have a mix of curl patterns on the same head. One side grows straight.</p>

<p>To successfully treat hair loss of any type, it is important to know what is behind the hair loss. I guess i feel this is one thing many curlies need to just accept. Basically, she told me i was doing a half assed job of blow drying the right side of my head and that is why it would end.</p>
