<p>So, why is my hair curly when wet but frizzy when dry? When your hair is 100% dry, not before, gently finger comb each wave out. Curls are naturally dry and more prone to get damaged. Brushing could be crushing your waves. I have a blog post on why you shouldn’t brush wavy hair that goes into more detail.</p>

<p>Well, first of all, you need proper moisture to lock in curls even when your hair is dry. While you may think that a simple natural hair care routine can moisturize your curls, caring for extremely dry hair comes with its own set of rules. Some say you can identify your curl. Also, wet hair is not a proper depiction,.</p>

<p>In tighter kinks, coils and curls, sebum can get stuck at the scalp, causing dullness and dryness. My curly hair is frizzy when it’s wet!!

<p>If you’re at your wit�s end when it. This again leads to frizz as well. My curly hair is frizzy when it’s wet!! When you wet healthy hair, it can actually absorb up to 30% of its own weight in water into the inner spongy cortex (more if it’s damaged hair). Hairdressers opt for a wet haircut to avoid having.</p>

<p>The only other times you can comb your curls is after applying a leave in conditioner (explained later in this post) outside the shower and sometimes with oil applied to your hair before you shower. Also, wet hair is not a proper depiction, as the water is weighing it down. So, why is my hair curly when wet but frizzy.</p>

<p>To make sure that your hair holds shape, you should make sure that the hair is healthy. Shrinkage is what you call the difference between the length of your hair when it’s wet and pulled straight compared to when it’s dry. The looser your curl pattern, the easier it is for sebum to travel from your roots to the tips.</p>
