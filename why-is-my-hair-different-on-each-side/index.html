Sometimes headshape really makes a big difference just from anecdotal evidence. It can make it greasy, too. If your hair goes “back and forth” from side to side like an s shape,.</p>

<p>That’s why it doesn’t hurt to get a haircut. This means that there are more hairs per square inch of scalp on the “thicker” side, and fewer on the side that “lays flatter”. It turns out this hair curling issue comes down to dominant hand dexterity and the tendency to do what’s. I also see a correlation of male pattern.</p>

<p>Hair texture is determined by multiple genes and alleles that differ among world populations. Perhaps you spend a lot of time driving in your car with the window down and your hair on one side is being blown more by the wind, causing the hair to be roughed up. I tried all the argan oils, and the somaluxe argan oil.</p>

<p>Telogen effluvium is a condition where the hair remains in the telogen (natural shedding) phase of the growth cycle. Perhaps you spend a lot of time driving in your car with the window down and your hair on one side is being blown more by the wind, causing the hair to be roughed up. Yes your hair can be curly.</p>

<p>Each hair follicle has its own blood supply, and it’s possible that one side of the head has better. In your case, it seems to be a matter of differing levels of hair density on one side versus the other. If your hair goes “back and forth” from side to side like an s shape, or in a loose corkscrew.</p>

<p>The answer is, yes it can. Hair texture is determined by multiple genes and alleles that differ among world populations. As for the “cause” it is likely simply a matter of genetics. Thick body hair is called androgenic hair because its growth depends on the production of androgens, a unisex hormone found in both men and women. A sudden increase.</p>

<p>Realistically it is unlikely that the hair on one side of your face grows in faster than the other. In order to get to the bottom of my hair curling problems, i met up with morgan roy, creative director at the aveda institute toronto. That’s why it doesn’t hurt to get a haircut. Hair texture is determined by multiple genes.</p>

<p>In your case, it seems to be a matter of differing levels of hair density on one side versus the other. A sudden increase in hair growth or loss in women is often caused by an imbalance of male hormones (androgens) which are naturally present in both men and. That’s why you need to wash your hair. Each hair follicle.</p>
