If you’re brushing too hard or roughly, it leads to cuticle damage, which makes the hair much more prone to frizz, she adds. My guess would be the weight of your hair is pulling down any higher curls.</p>
<h3 id="hair-types-3a-and-below-starts-curling-a-few-inches-below-the-roots">Hair types 3a and below starts curling a few inches below the roots.</h3><p>There�s a possibility that the straighter hair on top is damaged by heat and exposure to the elements, in which case i would recommend deep conditioning to add moisture back to your hair.
