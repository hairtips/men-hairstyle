<p>Giving your preferred styling side a break can give your hair follicles time to strengthen so that that side of your hair can appear stronger and thicker again. I include many ways to get tighter curls, encourage shrinkage, and. One side of my head is 2c and the other is 3a. Sometimes i want to cry while my hair.</p>
<h3 id="that-ideal-length-can-be-found-by-utilizing-the-accompanying-strategy">That ideal length can be found by utilizing the accompanying strategy:</h3><p>In order to get to the bottom of my hair curling problems, i met up with morgan roy, creative director at the aveda institute toronto. My back on the right is more prone to tangles no matter what i use or do, it will tangle up like a demon. I always style my hair the same on both sides, but one side always curls a lot better than the other. It turns out this hair curling issue comes down to dominant hand dexterity and the tendency to do what’s “more comfortable” first. However, sometimes one part of the scalp is exposed to more stresses from the environment and styling than the rest of the head and the hair will behave differently as a result. It creates this really strange looking uneven look.</p>

<p>Nothing you can really do anything about, anyway. My left side vs my right side.

<p>If you favor sleeping on one side or the other, you may be experiencing some erosion of the hair due to rubbing against the pillows or bed linens. My left side vs my right side. I know how it feels. I have been having problems with one side of my hair for a while now. I always style my hair.</p>

<p>It almost makes me not want to wear my hair curly sometimes because it just looks so weird to have beautiful coils on one side and almost bone straight hair on the other side.

<p>The right side of my head has beautiful ringlets. These are probably building up in your hair and weighing down your curls. If you favor sleeping on one side or the other, you may be experiencing some erosion of the hair due to rubbing against the pillows or bed linens. I can�t cut the top of my hair short in.</p>

<p>The layers will not grow down and they seem to be getting shorter due to breakage! Method 2 and 3 both give me straight hair at the back at most 2a, method 1 usually gives me about 80% straight hair and then if any water touches it then it. I know how it feels. I cannot express how much rage.</p>

<p>Most hair does not change drastically, although it has been known to happen. The right side of my head has beautiful ringlets. Although hair is a much studied topic some aspects still remain a mystery, including why straight hair suddenly becomes curly or vice versa. And when i’m in the mood for the most curly hair i scrunch it with.</p>

<p>To combat this try pineappling your hair and putting in a satin cap (this should also help keep your hair a bit more moist) the second thing i find can do it, is i naturally always go to brush, style and touch one side a lot more than the other, which can seem kind of simple and like it couldn�t.</p>

<p>Also, i used to do something similar to jewelcurls in that i would subconsciously treat one side of my hair differently than the other, like pulling my hair over my one shoulder to put condish in, but not flipping it over the other. I always style my hair the same on both sides, but one side always curls a lot.</p>

<p>I think it�s because you�re sleeping on your side, it flattens the hair. I know how it feels. I always style my hair the same on both sides, but one side always curls a lot better than the other. That still only does so much. It creates this really strange looking uneven look.</p>

<p>I already know that one of the reasons why the right side of my hair is thinner (and grows slower) than the left is because i prefer to sleep on my right side. I have been having problems with one side of my hair for a while now. To combat this try pineappling your hair and putting in a satin.</p>
