Can I wet my hair after a perm? The stylist combed my hair From quora.com</p>
<p>I suggest you steer clear from shampoo after a perm; You washed your perm too early; Your hair gets very thick and puffy when you cut it short. Therefore, this is also the reason why you should perm your hair before coloring it.</p>
<h3 id="you-cannot-blow-dry-your-hair-after-a-perm">You cannot blow dry your hair after a perm.</h3><p>That said, the straight perm is, in essence, damaging to the hair strand. Due to the fact that the cuticle is raised already during the perming procedure, the peroxide readily enters the hair and dissolves the color, even though the peroxide solution is significantly milder in the perm formula compared to hair color. A more common type of hair loss from perms is breakage. It’s wavy when wet, but dries straight. So, i went to the salon and. At this stage, your hair is in shock.to help you hair to take to the perm you need to do a rinse of apple cider vinegar mixed with an equal part of water, and leave it alone.after your hair has had a few days to chill out &amp; recover ,and you go to style it, you should not brush it with a brush, rather you should use a wide hair pick and pick it, to prevent it from being too frizzy.</p>

<p>Therefore, this is also the reason why you should perm your hair before coloring it. A hair strand is composed of multiple layers, with an outer layer that forms a protective sheath around the delicate inner strands. Your hair is very frizzy, especially when it is humid. The two main reasons for permed hair not being as curly as desired.</p>

<p>Get regular contact with stylist. That said, the straight perm is, in essence, damaging to the hair strand. In my experience with perms, if you�ve wound it well with small sections, left the lotion on until you get a good �s� shape forming and rinsed and neutralised well, you can�t make that hair straight again unless you use chemicals. It.</p>

<p>Washing hair and taking care of it after the perm is a common subject of discussion. Apply an intense curling product, like extra strong hair gel, on the specific locks that are straight. On the other hand, straight hair can be wrapped around metal bars that are heated to activate a perm, causing your hair follicles to be restructured by.</p>

<p>Hair breakage after a permanent hair straightening treatment is somewhat common. You haven’t done nourishing treatments on your hair; The chemical solution works by, in essence, damaging your hair so it lies flat or releases its natural curl. This is referred to as a digital perm or digital perms. The level of frizz you describe leads me to think that.</p>

<p>So, i went to the salon and. Why is my perm not curly? Otherwise, your hair may be damaged and the curls would disappear or become uneven. So, don’t be afraid of volume! Your hair looks poofy or fluffy.</p>

<p>I recently had a soft loose perm done four weeks ago. Results will fade but your hair structure (that it was applied to, not the new growth!) is forever changed so adding more chemicals on top will at minimum skew results and at worst very seriously damage hair. Otherwise, you risk that the color fades. Otherwise, your hair may be.</p>

<p>Lightly spritz the curl with a styling spray or light hair spray. Even from a drop of rain also from the conditioner if you want to keep your perm intact and crisp. Washing hair and taking care of it after the perm is a common subject of discussion. Use a curling iron only after your hair is completely dry. You.</p>

<p>I don�t know what to do and it looks terrible! I suggest you steer clear from shampoo after a perm; For example, your hair may be too kinky or damaged to allow the perm to take properly. In my experience with perms, if you�ve wound it well with small sections, left the lotion on until you get a good �s�.</p>
