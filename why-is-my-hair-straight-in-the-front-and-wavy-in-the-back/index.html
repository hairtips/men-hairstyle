Curls Week Why did my hair change from straight to curly From hairromance.com</p>
<p>Just wash with shampoo, rinse, then use conditioner, rinse, and then “squish” your hair up to your scalp to see if waves form. Mixed texture meaning that some strands are wavy, others are curly/kinky, or. For an example, see this post. The rest of my hair is wavy.</p>
<h3 id="the-hairstyle-is-not-fussy-but-always-the-highlight-of-the-girls-in-the-crowd">The hairstyle is not fussy but always the highlight of the girls in the crowd.</h3><p>If i brush my hair, it�s similar to your front bits, if i leave it alone it�s a lot like the back. As well as affecting the quality of your hair, hormones can change your muscle tone too. Bumble &amp; bumble hair cream is known to work for improving waves. How my hair looked when wet was another sign that it was naturally wavy, not straight. I did this, and i saw more waves and more defined waves in my hair than before, but the difference was fairly subtle. I also find that the back/bottom of mine is curlier, maybe due to less damage from the sun/environment and brushing.</p>

<p>It is at its peak after i wash it, as my curls are moisture activated. This haircut makes the most of you long hair, keeping all the length and thickness you’re worked hard to grow. While i�m thinking about it, a lot of people see hair texture changes at puberty because of the massive hormonal shift. Just wash with shampoo,.</p>

<p>If i brush my hair, it�s similar to your front bits, if i leave it alone it�s a lot like the back. At first i thought this was beacause of damaged hair but as my curls developed and i took better care of it (it took a while but my hair is now healthy) i realized that wasn�t the issue..</p>

<p>It really worked!also try really scrunching it with some styling gel. I�ve basically only have curls in the front, while my hair in the back before cgm was dry and fluffy rather than curly. Layers around the face are short enough to fall. It�s still straight even when i don�t sleep on it.when it�s wet it�s straight while the other.</p>

<p>Just wash with shampoo, rinse, then use conditioner, rinse, and then “squish” your hair up to your scalp to see if waves form. I think it has to do with the length of your hair combined with the products you use, as someone already mentioned. Your stylist probably cut as much hair as she could to help you retain length.</p>

<p>You could select a curl size that would soften the wave in the back and would add curl to the straight hair in front, match the front of the hair to the back in curl size, or basically select any size curl you desire. How my hair looked when wet was another sign that it was naturally wavy, not straight..</p>

<p>Straight hair follicles grow straight out but curly hair follicles have a hook shape. If you are just trying this the first time, you do not have to do that.

<p>When my hair started to get curly (was stick straight as a kid), it started doing so right behind the crown. My hair is most curly around my temples. If you are already treating your hair as wavy, here are reasons why it might only be wavy at the ends. Mixed texture meaning that some strands are wavy, others are.</p>

<p>When your hair is cut wet, it’s shorter than you wanted once it dries. If you don’t want to get into any complications to enhance your wavy hair, you can divide them into segments, twist them with your fingers and blow dry them individually. I usually end up pulling the front pieces back because otherwise it looks weird to have.</p>

<p>It could also be that you have mixed texture. Your waves in the back look nice but if you want them to be curly like the front of your head, you need your hair to lay differently than how it is currently layered. The hair in the back may be longer from root to end, if so their length weighs.</p>

<p>For a shorter �do, try an asymmetrical bob where the back is shorter than the front. Your waves in the back look nice but if you want them to be curly like the front of your head, you need your hair to lay differently than how it is currently layered. Wavy hair is weighed down more easily than curly hair..</p>

<p>Not even the color is consistent. It�s still straight even when i don�t sleep on it.when it�s wet it�s straight while the other parts of my hair are wavy.

<p>Your hair may only be wavy at the ends if it’s weighed down. I think your hair is fine like mine, and in my experience basically anything can make my hair fall out of its waves into straightness.
