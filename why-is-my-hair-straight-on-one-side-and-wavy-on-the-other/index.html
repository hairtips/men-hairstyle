<p>I used to blow dry or straighten my hair a lot to make it fall more evenly, but i�ve been trying to avoid using heat. How long did it last (how long did your hair stay straight)? The constant pressure and friction can, over time, either make your thinner side much weaker or the thicker side can become more damaged over time. In your case, you should ask yourself if there is any correlation between your daily routine and having the hair display two different wave patterns on the sides of the head.</p>
<h3 id="my-crown-hair-for-me-is-wirey-and-kinky-and-wavey-then-the-hair">My crown hair for me is wirey and kinky and wavey, then the hair.</h3><p>Type 1 hair is straight hair. The problem is that it flicks out on one side and on the other it curves inwards a bit, which makes it look uneven. It starts with your genetics. Sometimes, it actually happens that, one person’s head can have different curl patterns, or the lack thereof. For example, the oval face, you can cut the bob hairstyle and combine a little bending curl lightly on the tail to create a highlight for the face. My hair has always done this, which can.</p>

<p>I am assuming that you are a male and not talking about minoxidil growth (which is less predictable a drug). Straight hair follicles grow straight out but curly hair follicles have a hook shape.

<p>December 2011 in information for newbies. As well as affecting the quality of your hair, hormones can change your muscle tone too. I have shoulder length layered hair with a side parting, and it has a slight wave in it. I’ve noticed from my own hair that after low haircuts my waves on the side occasionally loose definition and depth..</p>

<p>December 2011 in information for newbies. Anyway, the left side turns out great and there is always some frizz from about the middle down on the right side. Type 1 hair is straight hair. The change of muscle tone could affect the shape of your hair follicles and their direction of growth. When i hit my 30’s, i noticed that.</p>

<p>When straight hair becomes curly this suggests that something is happening to the shape of the hair follicles but no one knows why that happens or what causes it, although hormones are considered to play a role even though there is presently no evidence to confirm this. It used to be the right side that would dry straighter then my.</p>

<p>It also has a unique look to it. The constant pressure and friction can, over time, either make your thinner side much weaker or the thicker side can become more damaged over time.

<p>I used to blow dry or straighten my hair a lot to make it fall more evenly, but i�ve been trying to avoid using heat. That is because the straight follicles make it easier for natural oils to travel up and down your strands. My hair was always a little wavy, but it was crazy thick when i was a.</p>

<p>1a is the rarest hair type. Having hair that looks straight but is poofy. My hair was always a little wavy, but it was crazy thick when i was a child and adolescent.

<p>Type 2 is wavy hair. This is because of the friction of the hair against the fibers of their pillow case. If you notice your hair is going from straight to curly, your hair follicles are changing. However, one problem remains the same: Me of the cartoon character who had long straight blonde hair on one side and then dark.</p>

<p>The hair on the sides tends to be thinner when compared to the top and back and this is what makes it take so long to wave up in comparison to the other sides. Oval tubes are oddly shaped on one side which causes the curl. It used to be the right side that would dry straighter then my ringlets.</p>

<p>When your hair is cut wet, it’s shorter than you wanted once it dries.

<p>Asymmetrical haircuts offer a cute and edgy way for women to shake things up while staying true to their personal style. This is because of the friction of the hair against the fibers of their pillow case. The curls on one side of my head never seem to match the curls on the other. Asymmetrical cuts start with short hair.</p>
