<p>I figured now that i had a problem this was the best place to ask. How my hair looked when wet was another sign that it was naturally wavy, not straight. Water weight can ruin your waves. If you have colored hair it could also lead to the loss of color.</p>
<h3 id="i-just-brush-my-hair-while-showering-andor-washing-my-hair-alone">I just brush my hair while showering and/or washing my hair alone.</h3><p>When it rains/if you sweat, the moisture resets your hair and because you haven�t brushed it, it curls a lot more because you haven�t messed with it so i just does its own thing. Dry brushing, especially if you don’t do so very gently, can cause damage by breaking your hair. Also, if you comb your hair out of the shower, that will relax the wave more, so you will want to scrunch or plop to help reshape the waves and curls. But on another note, your hair has to be fully or properly trained for you not to lose them. I only brush my hair when it is wet and plop when i get out of the shower, i use mouse or gel in it. Having hair that looks straight but is poofy is one sign of having wavy hair or curly hair.</p>

<p>This helps in sealing the cuticles and making your hair shiny. Curly/wavy hair follicles are more oval so not as much oil comes out. If you’ve been skipping the conditioner or not applying enough, it could be the reason why your hair is always frizzy after a shower. Straight hair follicles grow straight out but curly hair follicles have a.</p>

<p>Most hair does not change drastically, although it has been known to happen. Ive been reading this forum for quite some time and its made such a difference in my hair! But on another note, your hair has to be fully or properly trained for you not to lose them. Brushing your hair after a shower will disrupt your curl.</p>

<p>After shampooing and conditioning, detangle your hair in the shower. This helps in sealing the cuticles and making your hair shiny. My hair is wavy and dry, i no poo and stay silicone free. Do this around your whole head. But if combing your hair in the shower with conditioner in it feels good for you, go for it!</p>

<p>I like to dry detangle with a behairful brush because it’s faster and easier for me. How my hair looked when wet was another sign that it was naturally wavy, not straight. It can also lead to dullness, moisture loss and lift your hair cuticles. This may be from water weighing hair down as it dries, or from hair being.</p>

<p>Just wash with shampoo, rinse, then use conditioner, rinse, and then “squish” your hair up to your scalp to see if waves form. It can also lead to dullness, moisture loss and lift your hair cuticles. Curly/wavy hair follicles are more oval so not as much oil comes out. I just brush my hair while showering and/or washing my hair.</p>

<p>This is why a wavy hair needs a gel or mousse to hold the texture when the hair dries (a slightly different principle to when your hair is straight and curled in the shower). The change of muscle tone could affect the shape of your hair follicles and their direction of growth. Dry brushing, especially if you don’t do so.</p>

<p>I just brush my hair while showering and/or washing my hair alone. After shampooing and conditioning, detangle your hair in the shower.
