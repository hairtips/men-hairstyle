Why is my hair wavy/curlyish in the back and straight in From reddit.com</p>
<p>You see, the gene for curly hair is not completely dominant. You won�t need to deep condition your curls are often, and will need a lighter deep conditioner when you do. Lately i’ve been dabbling more in diffusing because love the results i get and i love that then i don’t have to deal with wet hair for hours. You see, here is a picture of me a couple years ago.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-my-hair-sometimes-wavy-and-sometimes-straight">Why is my hair sometimes wavy and sometimes straight?</h3><p>Illness and stress both illness and stress can take a toll on the body. You can see how my hair is minimally wavy, but not straight. How long your hair stays wet. That�s because the hair follicle of straight hair is circular and allows natural oils to come out from the scalp, which is why they wash their hair so much because it gets greasy. There are three growth phases for hair growth—the length of hair increases at the anagen phase. Two days after all that, i wet my hair completely.</p>

<p>Curly/wavy hair follicles are more oval so not as much oil comes out. And sometimes i really want to give up :(help. If you sometimes brush your hair after the shower, and sometimes skip brushing it, this has the potential to make your hair wavy sometimes (when you don’t brush) and straighter sometimes (when you do brush it). Do you.</p>

That�s because the hair follicle of straight hair is circular and allows natural oils to come out from the scalp, which is why they wash their hair so much because it gets greasy.

<p>You won�t need to deep condition your curls are often, and will need a lighter deep conditioner when you do. My hair is wavy is the front.and straight in the back! I’d definitely recommend cutting some of the dead ends. You can fix it by using a clarifying shampoo and switching to products with fewer oils/butters, or using a smaller.</p>

<p>Muscular changes frequently occur during puberty, menopause and chemotherapy when medications and hormones alter the muscle tone of the hair follicle. Illness and stress both illness and stress can take a toll on the body. It starts with your genetics. Having hair that looks straight but is poofy. Scientists can’t say for certain what makes your straight hair turn wavy.</p>

<p>Curly/wavy hair follicles are more oval so not as much oil comes out. So when you walk into a humid room, it’s like you’re surrounding your hair with tiny magnets pulling your hair in different directions. Your waves are more likely to have low porosity. You won�t need to deep condition your curls are often, and will need a lighter.</p>

<p>When people with straight hair get a bit of frizz, it’s often because their hairs aren’t well aligned. It starts with your genetics. This is a bit of an odd one. Your waves are more likely to have low porosity. You�ll need to clarify your strands regularly to avoid build up, which will drag your strands down.</p>

<p>Then i applied olaplex no. While i’m very grateful for the curly girl movement online, as it has taught me a lot about my own hair, i think it has led us to have unreal expectations. Do you have curly or coily hair, or just want to learn more? The shorter you go the more body and bounce you will.</p>

<p>Wavy hair that feels heavy is likely caused by build up or products that are too heavy. Your waves are more likely to have low porosity. Sometimes the change in hair texture can be extreme. When i don�t wash my hair, i will get it wet to restyle or leave as is. It�s just so hard and i feel worse.</p>

<p>Your hair gets very thick and puffy when you cut it short. Water weight can ruin your waves. Sometimes i air dry, and sometimes i diffuse. Knowing what products work for your hair is key. The wave begins at the roots, resulting in a lot of volume.</p>

<p>It starts with your genetics. In term of caring, there is no particular difference between curly and wavy hair, both of them should be paid a lot of attention. There are three growth phases for hair growth—the length of hair increases at the anagen phase. It can remain dormant until activated and then it changes the shape of the hair.</p>

<p>Why you shouldn’t brush wavy hair. I’d definitely recommend cutting some of the dead ends. It’s very normal to have a mix of curl patterns on the same head of hair. Two days after all that, i wet my hair completely. Often wavy hair needs support from gel or mousse to maintain its texture as it dries.</p>

<p>Muscular changes frequently occur during puberty, menopause and chemotherapy when medications and hormones alter the muscle tone of the hair follicle. The same type of humid weather that can make straight hair fall flat can enhance your curls, or even turn casually wavy hair into ringlets. I dry it with a high speed on medium/low heat. There are three growth.</p>

<p>A few things to know about wavy hair: When i do wash my hair (1x/2x a week) i use aveda�s be curly shampoo and conditioner. But it’s likely a unique combination of genes, hormones, and medication because all. Poofy because i did not add any hair gel to form structured waves, but i liked the end product. Your waves are.</p>

<p>You see, here is a picture of me a couple years ago. Sometimes the change in hair texture can be extreme. And just as hormones may impact hair texture, any medications that affect hormones, such as glucocorticoids or thyroxine, could also potentially make hair become wavy or curly. That�s because the hair follicle of straight hair is circular and allows.</p>
