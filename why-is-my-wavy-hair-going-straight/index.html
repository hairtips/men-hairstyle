<p>The change of muscle tone could affect the shape of your hair follicles and their direction of growth. Growing older makes your curly hair patterns get straighten and elongated at ends and this happens because your hair gets mature, older, brittle, and also thin and dull. Not even the color is consistent. Styling, detangling, and brushing hair vigorously when it’s.</p>

<p>This happens more than you would think. Your hair gets very thick and puffy when you cut it short. I usually clean my body and let the shampoo sit while i�m cleaning, this is optional. I do this once a week, depending on how dirty my hair is. Dunk your hair under the water for just a second, as some.</p>

<p>Straight hair can become greasy and limp quickly, so it’s important that it is washed frequently; Make sure you can feel the scalp, not just the hair. After going 2 days without washing my hair it goes back to being straight wavy. Scientists don�t know exactly why this happens, but it probably has to do with a combination of genetics,.</p>

<p>This shift and transformation are proven by lots of master hairstylists. Once a week, restore and strengthen your hair with either a diy protein treatment or a good deep conditioner. This may be from water weighing hair down as it dries, or from hair being brushed or combed. Styling, detangling, and brushing hair vigorously when it’s dry also accelerates the.</p>

<p>This happens more than you would think. I blowdried my hair through all of middle school and high school, and i straightened it for the past two years. If the hair is very straight or rough, then it may not be windy enough to produce a straight rather than curly look. After going 2 days without washing my hair it.</p>

<p>We can say that as you grow older, your curly hair will get straight ends. But it looks much healthier and shinier. Aging affects the hair follicles, but it is rarely a cause of curly hair. Make sure you can feel the scalp, not just the hair. If you’re washing your hair excessively, using the wrong products or adding excessive.</p>

<p>Dry shampoo should become your staple product. Hair that is wavy when wet but dries straight is naturally wavy hair that is being weighed down or stretched out. Why does wavy hair dry straight? Also, strong shampooing is another cause of straight hair. I think my hair is becoming straight.</p>
