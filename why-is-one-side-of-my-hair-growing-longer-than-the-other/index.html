<p>The experiment involved cutting the hair and then measuring its. If you hair is 4, 56 7 inches longer than the other side.there is a problem that you�re going to have to figure out. It is a possibility that one side of your face has more hair follicles than the other therefore beard would grow faster on that side. More hair loss on one side is common.</p>
<h3 id="this-breakage-can-make-the-hair-appear-to-take-longer-to-grow-out-when-in-reality-it-is-growing-at-the-appropriate-speed">This breakage can make the hair appear to take longer to grow out when in reality it is growing at the appropriate speed.</h3><p>Some hairs grow more out to the side while others grow straight down. Hair loss can be caused by a number of factors, which include genetics, diet, medication, overuse of perms or straightening and your body’s natural cycle. Or why one side of your hair is thicker than the other? It is because more blood reaches to the side than the top. Also, as your hair gets heavier with more length, the bottom is going to get flattened out the most as it grows, so it�s going to make it look longer than the fluffier top layers as well. Studies may indicate a faster growth in back of head versus front various studies have shown that hair at the back of the head may tend to have a faster growth rate in some cases than the front of the head.</p>
