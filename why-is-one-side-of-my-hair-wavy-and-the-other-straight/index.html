<p>Basically, she told me i was doing a half assed job of blow drying the right side of my head and that is why it would end up that way. Blow dry it after washing or at least wetting it as you brush. My current routine is to dry it with a t shirt, put in some leave in conditioner.</p>

<p>But i also haven’t figured out how to give the straight side more volume so my hair just ends up looking uneven. I have a bit of a problem. For example, the oval face, you can cut the bob hairstyle and combine a little bending curl lightly on the tail to create a highlight for the face. Most hair does.</p>

<p>As it dries, i continue to comb the ends down, to prevent them from flipping out so much. Having hair that looks straight but is poofy is one sign of having wavy hair or curly hair. If i try to straighten the wavy side, it looks like a frizzy, damaged mess. Mine does this also after i blow it dry,.</p>

<p>As it dries, i continue to comb the ends down, to prevent them from flipping out so much. Wavy hair underneath and straight on top. Did she use thinning shears? It almost makes me not want to wear my hair curly sometimes because it just looks so weird to have beautiful coils on one side and almost bone straight hair.</p>

<p>It doesn’t even hold a curl! When your hair is cut wet, it’s shorter than you wanted once it dries. If so, that may be why your hair looks uneven. One side of my head is 2c and the other is 3a. 1a is the rarest hair type.</p>

<p>One side of my hair is curlier than the other if you find that one side of your head (or the back) is straighter than the rest, this can be from friction damage while sleeping. I used to blow dry or straighten my hair a lot to make it fall more evenly, but i�ve been trying to avoid using heat..</p>

<p>My hair tends to flip out at one side as well, while the other lays flat. For example, the oval face, you can cut the bob hairstyle and combine a little bending curl lightly on the tail to create a highlight for the face. However, it’s more likely to see thinning hair than straight hair becoming curly during this phase.</p>

<p>I am black and my new growth comes in wavy and is sensitive in the middle top part of my head. Most hair does not change drastically, although it has been known to happen. Having hair that looks straight but is poofy is one sign of having wavy hair or curly hair. The curls on one side of my head.</p>

<p>Wavy hair underneath and straight on top. Also my right side of my hair is wavy and thicker than my left side which is more straight and thick but not as thick as my other side.i wish my straight side would match the wavy side.what could i do to. I guess i feel this is one thing many curlies need.</p>
