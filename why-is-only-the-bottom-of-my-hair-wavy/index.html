<p>I think the moisture of my wet hair, paired with the fact that it is so close to my face (body heat) makes a sort of humid hair climate, so the parts of my ahir that are closer to my head are more. It concerns me, because a friend of mine here in vegas, her sister died at age 42.</p>

<p>So, why does my hair curl up at the ends? It could also be that you have mixed texture. You see, when external layers are cut, all the weight of your hair is removed from the outside of your hair. How to know your curl type and the products that work. Or maybe your hair might be damaged.</p>

<p>It starts with your genetics. If you have wavy or curly hair, you will most likely begin to see a wavy or curly pattern taking shape as a result of scrunching.
