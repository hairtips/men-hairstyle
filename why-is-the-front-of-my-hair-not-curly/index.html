<p>I can curl it with my fingers, scrunch it all day, blow dry it upside down, put product in upside down, it always comes out the same way. Honest “tips” to remember when curling straight hair: When i wear it loose, it gives the illusion that my entire head is full. I had the same problem because i would always.</p>

<p>Maybe try a protein treatment. 7 you’re brushing out your curls. 6 your hair is too clean. 1 you’re not using the right tools. Your body heat and pressure (laying against your hair) can stretch out your curls in the back of your head more than the front.</p>

<p>If you do the same, then those products may still be built up on your hair preventing your curls from showing through. Naturally curly hair is naturally dry. Welcome to our hair consultations column. It’s not enough to just condition your hair in the shower. Your waves in the back look nice but if you want them to be curly.</p>

<p>6 your hair is too clean. I hate this so much, because i always get weird stares and i. This temporary breakdown allows the hair to mold itself into your desired shape — curly hair can temporarily be straightened by using a flat iron, or straight hair can temporarily be made curly by using a curling wand. You can imagine.</p>

<p>The smaller the sections (when curling), the better. It was straight like my mom’s for the longest time, and now it’s starting to curl around my hairline. My hair is like that too. Your waves in the back look nice but if you want them to be curly like the front of your head, you need your hair to lay.</p>

<p>Next i�d suggest going in for a haircut. Im assuming your hair is naturally straight, but the ends in the fr. I can link you to my curly hair board too if you want. Using heat on your hair temporarily breaks the weak hydrogen bonds in your hair making it moldable and easy to alter. You�re doing all the right.</p>

<p>Likewise, cut hair shorter in front if it is straighter than the hair in the back. The idea in curling straight hair is not to miraculously hope your hair “curls” or curls more naturally, but rather to prep it in allowing the ability to take on a “curl shape” through the use of heat, then holding that curl shape temporarily.;.</p>

<p>When i have oil on my hair it frizzes and just looks wild. Your waves in the back look nice but if you want them to be curly like the front of your head, you need your hair to lay differently than how it is currently layered. However, if this does not work, cut the straight hair underneath shorter than.</p>

<p>Your body heat and pressure (laying against your hair) can stretch out your curls in the back of your head more than the front. My hair is like that too. I know that my hair does not like products with oil. Using heat on your hair temporarily breaks the weak hydrogen bonds in your hair making it moldable and easy.</p>
