<p>Hairstylist when i was little told me this is from heat damage from too much sun. However, the hair underneath is curlier than the rest of your hair.

<p>You mentioned that your curls came back, and this is normal too, as you age and hormones in your body change your hair will too. This meant that lots of the top layer (which wasn’t curling well) got cut much shorter. The top layer of your hair is straight and curly underneath because you probably have a mixed hair type..</p>

However, genetics and hair damage are.</p>
