<p>The top layer undergoes more abrasion and eventually becomes straighter and more curly. It’s more evident, when the hair is grown longer than shoulder length. Likewise, cut hair shorter in front if it is straighter than the hair in the back. You mentioned that your curls came back, and this is normal too, as you age and hormones in your body change your hair will too.</p>
<h3 id="to-combat-this-the-usual-advice-from-stylists-is-choppy-layers-to-make-the-underneath-not-so-heavy">To combat this, the usual advice from stylists is choppy layers, to make the underneath not so heavy.</h3><p>It is a common problem for the top layer of fine hair to be damaged—it takes all of the abuse. There�s a possibility that the straighter hair on top is damaged by heat and exposure to the elements, in which case i would recommend deep conditioning to add moisture back to your hair. My hair is as wavy (like a spiral perm on my left side of my head) all the hair from the left side over. Maybe try scrunching and plopping after showering to up your wave pattern. I don’t know how true that is and i have no science to back up but i have the same issue. I have been thinking, as a previous poster said, that is it due to the outside layer of my hair drying faster and falls straight (it looks wavier when wet then falls).</p>
