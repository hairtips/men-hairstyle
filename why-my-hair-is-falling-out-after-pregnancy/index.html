Why does the hair fall out after women give birth From endhairloss.eu</p>
<p>(podcast episode 2020) quotes on imdb: The excessive shedding is caused by falling estrogen levels. There are fewer hairs in the resting stage and fewer falling out each day, so you may have thicker, more luxuriant tresses. It is more common for hair to fall out after the birth of the baby rather than when you are pregnant.</p>
<h3 id="insufficient-intake-of-nutritious-food-often-results-in-hair-loss">Insufficient intake of nutritious food often results in hair loss.</h3><p>Sometimes, however, women lose hair during pregnancy. Then your hormones level out in the months following childbirth. Besides, if you experience nausea in the first trimester, most nutrients are lost. Most women lose a lot of hair a few months after giving birth. Does breastfeeding make your hair fall out? This is normal — and not true hair loss.</p>
