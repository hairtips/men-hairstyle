</center> <p><strong>Will A Short Pixie Cut Suit Me</strong>, With a pixie cut, your hair is shaped to the top of your head, which is different than the typical cut for longer hair that just goes straight across. A shorter cut can add body to fine, straight strands, but the trick is all in the styling.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://hairtips.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=will%20a%20short%20pixie%20cut%20suit%20me" alt="177 Pixie Cut Ideas to Suit All Tastes In 2021" title="177 Pixie Cut Ideas to Suit All Tastes In 2021" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https:\/\/hairtips.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg';" class="center" />
177 Pixie Cut Ideas to Suit All Tastes In 2021 From lovehairstyles.com</p>
<p>Some hairstyles like the bob pixie cut and the lob (long bob) pixie cut involve cutting hair short around the face with an added layer of hair on top that is longer than the rest. Take a ruler and place it perpendicularly under your ear. If the measurement of where the pencil meets the ruler is lesser than 2.25 inches, then short hair will suit your face. I should mention, i am 16 and have broad shoulders.</p>
<h3 id="or-if-you-have-a-longer-face-get-fewer-layers-and-add-some-sweeping-side-bangs-to-balance-out-your-face-shape">Or, if you have a longer face, get fewer layers and add some sweeping side bangs to balance out your face shape.</h3><p>If the measurement of where the pencil meets the ruler is lesser than 2.25 inches, then short hair will suit your face. The pixie is cut longer on one side and short on the other. Take a ruler and place it perpendicularly under your ear. You just need to keep a few guidelines in mind. And there is no such thing as a pixie cut that suits everyone! The ruler and pencil will now create a “t region” with each other.</p>
