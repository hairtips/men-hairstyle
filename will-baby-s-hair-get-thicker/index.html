<p>Whether you’re a guy or girl, there’s one thing i think we all dream of: Is it true that shaving a baby’s head (or cutting his hair very short) makes the hair grow in thicker and stronger? Your child’s hair grows at an average rate of approximately one quarter to one half an inch every month, with a yearly average of approximately five to six inches. If you have a big event coming up and a little bit of time to work on the health of your locks, it could be possible to get hair looking thicker in as little as a month, simply by protecting and conditioning its length.</p>
<h3 id="if-your-baby-has-soft-and-gentle-tresses-even-you-may-want-to-shave-his-head-hoping-that-your-baby-will-have-thick-and-dense-hair-later">If your baby has soft and gentle tresses, even you may want to shave his head hoping that your baby will have thick and dense hair later.</h3><p>Genetics control hair color and texture. To help stimulate thicker, fuller hair, gently apply coconut oil to your baby’s scalp a few times per week. You won’t have much hair care if your baby doesn’t have much hair at all. The vitamins and nutrients may improve the hair’s natural sheen, which may make it appear thicker. It may appear thicker but that�s only because the fine ends of the hair have been removed. Many people believe that cutting a baby’s head can make the hair grow thicker.</p>
