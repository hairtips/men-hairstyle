<p>Take this  what haircut suits me quiz and discover what haircut will look good on you. In truth it takes far too long before the style looks good again. The �ruler rule� is a formula that lets you find out quickly if a short haircut will be a hit or a flop. For an accurate consultation, it is essential that you select your correct face shape and answer all questions correctly.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-time-of-doubt-has-passed">But the time of doubt has passed!</h3><p>The measurement that you should keep in mind is 5.5 cm (just over 2 ⅛ inches). This will visually shorten the width of your face and tricks the eye into thinking your face is narrower. You may not want to go as short as the pixie, but you may be able to wear a shorter bob. 4) people with perfectly oval shaped faces are lucky. The middle part here helps elongate your face, making it seem less round and full. Take this short curly hairstyle for example.</p>
